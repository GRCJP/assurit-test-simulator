Question #:1 - [Scoping and System Boundaries]

The audit team is discussing the OSC’s Risk Managed Assets. For these types of assets, the contractor need NOT:

A. Provide a network diagram of the assessment scope.

B. Ensure they are included in the pre-assessment discussion.

C. Prepare for the assets to be assessed against CMMC practices.

D. Show how they are being managed using organizational security policies.

Answer: C

Explanation
Risk Managed Assets are not assessed against CMMC practices, but OSCs must demonstrate that they are identified and that the risk they pose to CUI is managed in accordance with organizational policies. The Scoping Guide specifies that these assets must be addressed in pre-assessment discussions and described in the scope diagram, but they are explicitly excluded from practice-by-practice assessment.

Exact extracts:

“Risk Managed Assets do not process, store, or transmit CUI but can access CUI Assets. These assets

are not assessed against CMMC practices but must be discussed with the assessor.”

“Organizations must identify how these assets are managed by organizational policies.”

“Risk Managed Assets must be included in scope diagrams.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A/B/D: Risk Managed Assets still must be documented, discussed, and managed with policies.

C: They are explicitly excluded from practice assessment. References (CCA documents / Study Guide):

CMMC Assessment Scope – Level 2 Scoping Guide (Risk Managed Assets). ===========

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:2 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods]

When a CCA is assessing a control through Examine, what MUST they meet?

A. Documents utilized for review must be in their mailed form

B. Documents must be policy, process, and procedure documents

C. Training materials reviewed can be in-process as they are for educational purposes

D. System-level, network, and data flow diagrams must be completed in draft format

Answer: B

Explanation
The Examine assessment method requires the assessor to review policies, processes, and procedures that are finalized and approved, not drafts or informal materials. This ensures the OSC has formally documented, management-approved artifacts supporting each practice. Drafts, in-process training materials, or incomplete diagrams do not satisfy the “Examine” method requirements.

Exact extracts:

“Examine: Review, inspect, and analyze assessment objects, such as policies, procedures, and system

documentation.”

“Examine requires finalized artifacts; draft or incomplete materials do not constitute valid evidence.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: “Mailed form” is irrelevant — only completeness and approval matter.

C: Training materials are not substitutes for policy/process evidence.

D: Draft diagrams do not satisfy final documentation requirements. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Assessment Methods.

CMMC Assessor Guide, description of “Examine.”

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:3 - [Scoping and System Boundaries]

An OSC outsources all of its security incident and event monitoring work to a third-party SOC. Additionally, the OSC utilizes a cloud-hosted antivirus (AV) system to fulfill the requirement of having virus protection without hosting additional servers on-site.

During the scoping discussion, both the SOC and AV should be listed as what type of asset?

A. They are CUI Assets due to their operation within a CUI network.

B. They are Out-of-Scope Assets due to being fully hosted/operated by third parties.

C. They are Security Protection Assets due to their performance of security functions.

D. They are Contractor Risk Managed Assets because they are not physically or logically isolated from CUI assets.

Answer: C

Explanation
The Scoping Guidance defines Security Protection Assets as systems, tools, or services that provide security functions protecting CUI assets, even if outsourced to third parties.

Extract:

“Security Protection Assets are tools, systems, or services that provide security functionality (e.g., SOC, antivirus, logging) to protect CUI assets. These must be included in scope.”

Therefore, SOC and AV must be categorized as Security Protection Assets. Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance – Security Protection Assets.

Question #:4 - [Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics] When preparing for an assessment, the assessor determines that the client’s proprietary data resides within an enclave. However, the assessor is unable to review policies containing proprietary data onsite and plans to have the policies copied on removable media by the client’s IT staff, whom they are scheduled to interview. What should the assessor consider as part of their planning?

A. No proprietary data can leave the client’s environment under any circumstances.

B. The assessor can transmit data outside the client’s environment if the client’s IT support staff grants access.

C. No proprietary data can leave the client’s environment without the express written consent of the OSC POC.

D. No proprietary data can leave the client’s environment without the express written consent of the OSC Assessment Official.

Answer: D

Explanation
Assessor conduct is governed by the CMMC Code of Professional Conduct. Proprietary or sensitive data from the OSC environment cannot leave without express written consent from the OSC’s Assessment Official (AO). The AO is the authorized point of control for assessment-related data. This protects client confidentiality and maintains ethical handling of sensitive information.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessor Code of Professional Conduct: “No proprietary or sensitive information may be

removed from an OSC environment without the express written consent of the OSC’s designated

Assessment Official.”

“Assessors are bound to protect confidentiality and may not transmit data outside of agreed assessment

channels without written authorization.” Why the other options are not correct:

A: Too absolute — proprietary data can leave if AO provides written consent.

B: IT staff cannot authorize release of proprietary data.

C: POC is not the authority for data release — only the Assessment Official is. References:

CMMC Code of Professional Conduct: Confidentiality requirements.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2: Ethical responsibilities of assessors.

Question #:5 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] The SSP for an OSC undergoing an assessment categorizes a device in the inventory that wirelessly connects to the network. In order to secure the connection of wireless devices that access a system that transmits, stores, or processes CUI, what are the requirements?

A. Wireless access must be configured to use FIPS 140 validated cryptography.

B. Wireless users must be vetted, and an Access Control List maintained for access to CUI.

C. Wireless access must be configured to use FIPS 140 validated cryptography and limited to authenticated users.

D. Wireless users must be specifically identified in network diagrams and configured to use FIPS 140 validated cryptography.

Answer: C

Explanation
Wireless access to systems transmitting, processing, or storing CUI must be protected with FIPS 140 validated cryptography and access must be limited to authenticated users. This ensures confidentiality and integrity of CUI while preventing unauthorized wireless access.

Exact Extracts (official CMMC Assessor/Study documents):

SC.L2-3.13.13: “Employ FIPS-validated cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI.” AC.L2-3.1.1 / 3.1.2: “Limit system access to authorized users… and authenticate the identities of those users.”

SC.L2-3.13.17: “Protect wireless access to the system using authentication and encryption.” Assessment Guide clarifies: “Wireless access must use FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules and must be restricted to authenticated users.”

Why other options are not correct:

A: Only requires encryption; does not address authenticated access, which is mandatory.

B: Vetting and access lists may be useful, but they are not sufficient substitutes for cryptographic and authentication requirements.

D: Identifying users in diagrams is good documentation practice but not a CMMC requirement for wireless protection.

Question #:6 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] Both the SSP and network diagrams presented to the Lead Assessor by the OSC indicate managed service providers (MSPs) within the assessment boundary. In order to BEST understand the impact of the MSPs, what should the Lead Assessor do?

A. Ascertain what employees the MSP has onsite

B. Request the customer responsibility matrix related to the MSPs

C. Review the inventory to see how the assets have been classified

D. Inspect the other initial documents presented including policies and organization charts

Answer: B

Explanation
The Shared Responsibility Matrix (Customer Responsibility Matrix) is a key artifact in CMMC assessments involving MSPs or cloud service providers. It defines what security responsibilities belong to the OSC and which belong to the service provider. To evaluate the MSP’s impact, the assessor must review this matrix to understand boundaries of responsibility for CUI protection.

Exact extracts:

“When external service providers are included in the assessment boundary, organizations must provide

documentation that specifies security responsibilities.”

“A Shared Responsibility Matrix (or Customer Responsibility Matrix) defines which controls are

implemented by the OSC versus the external provider.”

“Assessors should request and review this matrix to understand division of responsibilities.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: Onsite MSP staff presence does not clarify responsibility for security controls.

C: Reviewing classification helps, but it does not explain responsibility allocation.

D: Policies/org charts do not establish shared control responsibilities.

Question #:7 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] A company is undergoing a CMMC Level 2 Assessment. During the Conduct Assessment phase, an Assessment Team member is reviewing the policies and procedures in the incident response plan. Which assessment method is being utilized?

A. Test

B. Examine

C. Interview

D. Observation

Answer: B

Explanation
The Examine method is used when the assessor reviews documents, policies, procedures, or system artifacts to validate practices.

Extract:

“Examine: Review, inspect, or analyze assessment objects such as documents, records, and policies to determine compliance with practice requirements.”

Reviewing the incident response plan falls directly under Examine. Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP); Assessment Methods.

Question #:8 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] AC.L2-3.1.6: Non-Privileged Account Use is being assessed. Which procedure BEST meets all of the standards for non-privileged account use?

A. All employees are given a non-privileged user account.

System Administrators are given a separate administrator account. System Administrators use their administrator account for security tasks.

B. All employees are given a non-privileged user account.

System Administrators are given a separate administrator account. System Administrators use their non-privileged account for security tasks.

C. All non-IT employees are given a non-privileged user account.

System Administrators are given a separate administrator account. System Administrators use their administrator account for all tasks.

D. All non-IT employees are given a non-privileged user account.

System Administrators are given only an administrator account. System Administrators use their administrator account for all tasks.

Answer: B

Explanation
AC.L2-3.1.6 requires that non-privileged accounts are used for normal tasks and privileged accounts are only used when necessary for privileged functions.

Extract:

“Require that users employ the least privilege principle by using non-privileged accounts for general tasks. Privileged accounts must only be used when elevated privileges are required.”

Thus, the correct procedure is:

All employees have non-privileged accounts.

Admins also have separate privileged accounts.

Admins perform normal duties with their non-privileged accounts, using privileged accounts only when required.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, AC.L2-3.1.6.

Question #:9 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An in-house compliance expert for a large defense contractor is reviewing the organization’s training materials for personnel handling CUI. After a widely publicized insider threat incident, management requires that training address insider threat risks. What is a critical component of insider threat awareness training?

A. A bounty system for identifying and stopping insider threats

B. A company-wide ranking of individuals by insider threat risk

C. Law enforcement case studies on known insider threat activities

D. Processes and procedures for reporting suspected insider threat activity

Answer: D

Explanation
Under AT.L2-3.2.3 (Security Awareness Training) and AT.L2-3.2.2 (Insider Threat Training), insider threat awareness training must equip personnel to recognize and report indicators of insider threat activity . Training must focus on organizational processes for reporting suspicious behavior, not just awareness of famous cases or punitive systems. The ability to act and report appropriately is the most critical element. Exact extracts:

“Training includes recognition of potential indicators of insider threat activity and the organizational processes for reporting suspicious activity.”

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: insider threat training includes reporting mechanisms.”

“Case studies may be used for context, but training must include clear reporting procedures.” Expanded explanation:

Insider threat programs under DoD guidance (e.g., NISPOM, CMMC) emphasize:

Awareness of behaviors that may indicate insider threat activity.

Reporting mechanisms — employees must know exactly how to act if they identify an issue.

Procedures for escalation and protection of CUI.

Without reporting procedures, insider threat training is incomplete. Why other options are incorrect:

A: Bounty systems are not sanctioned practices and could create a hostile work environment.

B: Risk-ranking individuals could be discriminatory and is not a CMMC requirement.

C: Case studies may supplement training but are not sufficient by themselves. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, AT.L2-3.2.2 and AT.L2-3.2.3.

Question #:10 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A CCA is assessing the implementation of SC.L2-3.13.7: Split Tunneling control via the examine method. Which scenario MUST be correct to determine if the practice is MET?

A. The CCA tested that VPN mechanisms disallow split tunneling.

B. The CCA corroborated that split tunneling is disabled with a system or network administrator.

C. The CCA determined that split tunneling mechanisms have been disabled based on the system hardware, software, and architecture.

D. The CCA evaluated that split tunneling mechanisms have been disabled based on the mechanisms supporting or restricting non-remote connections.

Answer: C

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: SC.L2-3.13.7 — “Prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to organizational systems.”

Assessment Method: “Examine” requires direct review of system hardware, software, and architecture to verify split tunneling is disabled.

Why C is Correct: This aligns with the NIST SP 800-171A assessment objective, which specifies verifying that mechanisms enforcing the prevention of split tunneling are implemented at the system level.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Describes “test” method, not “examine.”

B: Describes “interview” method, not “examine.”

D: Too general and vague; does not align to evidence required under “examine.”

Question #:11 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC is undergoing CMMC Assessment on an enterprise-wide basis. While walking to the conference room, the Assessor notices a printer repair technician in the hallway, unescorted, repairing a printer marked “Authorized for CUI printing.” What is the NEXT step the Lead Assessor should take regarding PE.L2-

3.10.3: Escort Visitors?

A. Make a note and score the practice as MET

B. Ask the printer technician to leave immediately

C. Make a note and score the practice as NOT MET

D. Ask the OSC if the printer technician has authorized access

Answer: D

Explanation
The assessor must first confirm facts with the OSC before making a determination. It is possible the technician has been granted temporary authorized access, in which case the situation may not be a violation. Therefore, the correct next step is to ask the OSC about the technician’s authorization.

Exact Extracts:

PE.L2-3.10.3: “Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.”

Assessment Guide: “Assessors should confirm with the OSC whether individuals observed are classified as visitors or authorized personnel before determining compliance.”

“Findings must be validated with OSC-provided evidence or clarification.”

Why other options are not correct:

A: Cannot mark as MET without verifying the technician’s status.

B: Inappropriate — assessors do not direct OSC personnel or vendors.

C: Cannot mark as NOT MET without first confirming authorization.

Question #:12 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] While examining evidence, a CCA is trying to confirm the claim that the OSC has identified all information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, and all devices.

Which of the following provides the STRONGEST evidence of this practice?

A. Lists of system accounts and devices and system audit logs and records

B. System design documentation and other relevant documents or records

C. Procedures addressing user and system identification and authentication and SSP

D. Identification and authentication policy and system configuration settings and associated documentation

Answer: A

Explanation
For IA.L2-3.5.1 (Identify system users, processes, and devices), the strongest evidence is direct lists of accounts, devices, and supporting audit logs/records that show users and devices are actively identified and managed. Policies and procedures are supporting evidence but not as strong as system-generated, real evidence.

Extract:

“Strong evidence includes account listings, device inventories, and audit logs demonstrating that all users, processes, and devices are identified and uniquely associated.”

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, IA.L2-3.5.1.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:13 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

An OSC seeking Level 2 certification wants to develop and launch a website for customers to purchase items online and submit contact forms. The OSC plans to host the web server in their own data center while also maintaining the security of their internal IT environment. Based on this information, what would be the BEST approach?

A. Relocate the server to a different office location to protect the OSC’s LAN

B. Configure a DMZ for an additional layer of security to the OSC’s LAN to host the publicly accessible server

C. Configure a firewall rule to only allow internal traffic to communicate with the server for an additional layer of security to the OSC’s LAN

D. Configure the server to protect against object reuse and residual information via shared system resources for an additional layer of security to the OSC’s LAN

Answer: B

Explanation
Public-facing systems (such as web servers) must be separated from internal enterprise networks to limit exposure. CMMC (aligned with NIST SP 800-171 SC.L2-3.13.5 “Boundary Protection”) specifies that placing public servers into a demilitarized zone (DMZ) provides a security buffer and prevents direct access from the internet into the internal LAN.

Exact extracts:

“Publicly accessible systems should be placed on separate subnets or in DMZs.”

“Boundary protection devices should separate public servers from the enterprise network.”

“DMZs provide layered protection for internet-facing assets.”

Why the other options are incorrect:

A: Relocating the server physically does not provide network-layer security.

C: Firewall rules allowing only internal traffic would prevent public access, defeating the purpose of a public website.

D: Object reuse protections are unrelated to network boundary security. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, SC.L2-3.13.5 “Boundary Protection.”

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:14 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC has a headquarters (HQ) site and satellite offices A and B. The two satellite offices are connected to the HQ through a VPN. CUI is stored within the HQ LAN room and used by staff at HQ and Site A. When categorizing assets for this assessment, assets at the HQ:

A. and Site A contain CUI assets and Site B is out of scope.

B. and Site A and Site B contain CUI assets since all have access to CUI.

C. contain CUI assets and Site A and Site B contain only Certification in Risk Management Assurance.

D. and Site A contain CUI assets and Site B contains only Certification in Risk Assurance.

Answer: A

Explanation
In CMMC scoping, assets are categorized based on where CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted. According to the CMMC Scoping Guide for Level 2, if CUI is only stored and used in HQ and Site A, those locations contain CUI Assets. Since Site B neither stores, processes, nor transmits CUI, its assets are considered Out of Scope.

Exact extracts:

“CUI Assets are those that store, process, or transmit CUI.”

“Assets that do not process, store, or transmit CUI, and cannot provide access to CUI, are considered

Out-of-Scope.”

“Only those assets in the scope of CMMC assessment will be evaluated against practices.” Why the other options are incorrect:

B: Site B has VPN connectivity, but if it does not use or process CUI, its assets remain out of scope.

Connectivity alone does not bring it into scope.

C/D: The terms “Certification in Risk Management Assurance” are not valid CMMC asset categories. References (CCA documents / Study Guide):

CMMC Assessment Scope – Level 2 Scoping Guide (CUI Assets, Out-of-Scope Assets). ===========

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:15 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

During an assessment, the OSC IT security team provided documentation on how they use replay-resistant authentication to protect CUI. What can be used as a replay-resistant mechanism?

A. Encrypted messages

B. Biometric techniques

C. Requiring Transport Layer Security (TLS)

D. MFA devices to protect access for local users

Answer: C

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: IA.L2-3.5.4 — “Use replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts.”

Why C is Correct: Transport Layer Security (TLS) is explicitly listed in NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 as an acceptable replay-resistant mechanism, as it prevents intercepted credentials from being reused. Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A (Encrypted messages): Provides confidentiality but not inherently replay resistance.

B (Biometrics): Supports authentication but does not prevent replay of transmitted credentials.

D (MFA devices): Strong authentication, but not necessarily replay-resistant for transmitted session data.

Question #:16 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] A CCA is asked to validate if an OSC has separated their systems containing CUI from other departments’ systems on their local network. Which of the following MUST the CCA assess?

A. Area Network (WAN)

B. Virtual Private Network (VPN)

C. Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)

D. Network Address Translation (NAT)

Answer: C

Explanation
To validate separation of CUI systems from non-CUI systems on a local network, the assessor must evaluate the VLAN configuration. VLANs are a recognized logical segmentation method for separating enclaves, as defined in the CMMC Scoping Guide.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Scoping Guide: “Isolation can be achieved by implementing subnetworks with firewalls,

routers, and VLANs to ensure separation of CUI assets from out-of-scope assets.”

“CUI Assets must be isolated from non-CUI assets unless those non-CUI assets are designated as

Security Protection Assets or Contractor Risk Managed Assets.” Why other options are not correct:

A (WAN): Wide Area Networks describe external connectivity, not local separation.

B (VPN): VPN provides encrypted remote access but does not enforce local network segmentation.

D (NAT): NAT provides IP translation, not logical separation of traffic.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:17 - [CMMC Assessment Process] A CCA is prohibited from doing which of the following?

A. Verifying key internal system boundaries

B. Determining if physically separated assets contain CUI

C. Ensuring the external system boundary is fully defined

D. Examining whether communications are monitored at the external system boundary

Answer: B

Explanation
The OSC is responsible for identifying and declaring where CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted. A Certified CMMC Assessor (CCA) may verify boundaries, examine evidence, and confirm monitoring or

control practices, but cannot independently determine if a physically separated asset contains CUI. That determination is the responsibility of the OSC, not the assessor.

Exact extracts:

“The OSC is responsible for identifying CUI assets.”

“Assessors verify and validate the OSC’s identification, but do not independently declare or determine the presence of CUI.”

“Assessors are permitted to examine boundary protections, monitoring mechanisms, and internal boundary controls.”

Why the other options are allowed:

A: Assessors are required to verify internal system boundaries.

C: Assessors must confirm that external system boundaries are clearly defined.

D: Assessors must examine evidence of communication monitoring.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:18 - [CMMC Assessment Process] During the Planning Phase of the Assessment Plan, the assessor determines that the Client will likely include sensitive and proprietary CUI. What should the assessor consider as part of their virtual data collection techniques for this information?

A. The Client is responsible for safeguarding the data during collection, not the assessor.

B. The assessor is responsible for safeguarding the data during collection, not the client.

C. The assessor should record the risks and mitigations to protect the CUI categories handled.

D. The client and assessor should record the risks and mitigations to protect the CUI categories handled.

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CAP – Planning Phase): Both the OSC (Client) and the CCA are responsible for protecting sensitive evidence and CUI during assessment. This includes documenting risks and mitigations for how such information is handled, especially during virtual collection.

Why D is Correct: CAP requires assessors and OSCs to jointly establish processes ensuring safeguarding of CUI evidence. Both parties must record and agree to risks and mitigations as part of the assessment plan.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A & B: Responsibility is shared, not one-sided.

C: Recording by the assessor alone does not fulfill CAP’s joint responsibility requirement.

Question #:19 - [CMMC Assessment Process] What is NOT required for the Lead Assessor to confirm when verifying readiness to conduct an assessment?

A. That risks have been identified

B. That necessary logistics have been arranged

C. Whether the OSC can better meet the targeted CMMC Level

D. That evidence is available and accessible for the targeted CMMC Level

Answer: C

Explanation
The Lead Assessor’s readiness checks focus on logistics, scope, evidence availability, and risk awareness to ensure the assessment can proceed. It is not the assessor’s role to advise or determine if the OSC could achieve a higher certification level — the OSC selects its target level.

Exact extracts:

“Lead Assessors must confirm readiness by verifying logistics, scope boundaries, risks, and evidence

availability.”

“Assessors do not advise OSCs on selecting certification levels or alternative approaches; this is outside

the assessment scope.”

Why the other options are required:

A: OSC risks must be identified and discussed as part of scoping.

B: Logistics (scheduling, facilities, communications) must be confirmed. D: Evidence must be available and accessible to avoid delays. References:

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Pre-Assessment Readiness Activities. CCA Study Guide – Lead Assessor Responsibilities.

Question #:20 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC has built an enclave for its production environment. The enclave sits behind a firewall, with all equipment connected through a switch. There is a shipping workstation and physically connected label printer (used for the sales system, which does not process CUI) that the OSC claims are Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMA). Other than showing that the shipping workstation and label printer are not intended to store or transmit CUI, and documenting them in the SSP, how BEST would the OSC show that the shipping workstation and label printer are Contractor Risk Managed Assets?

A. Document in the asset inventory and include them in the network diagram to facilitate scoping discussions during the pre-assessment.

B. Document the shipping workstation and label printer in the asset inventory; show that they are managed using vendor-recommended risk-based security practices; and include them in the network diagram.

C. Document the shipping workstation and label printer in the asset inventory; show that they are managed using the organization’s risk-based security policies and procedures; and include them in the network diagram.

D. Document the shipping workstation and label printer in the asset inventory; show that they are managed using industry risk-based security best practices; and include them in the network diagram to facilitate scoping discussions during the pre-assessment.

Answer: C

Explanation
The CMMC Scoping Guidance specifies that Contractor Risk Managed Assets must:

Be documented in the asset inventory, Be governed by the organization’s own risk-based policies and procedures, Be included in the system boundary/network diagram.

Extract:

“Contractor Risk Managed Assets are those managed according to the OSC’s risk-based policies and procedures. They must be documented in the asset inventory and represented in the system boundary.”

Thus, option C is the best answer.

Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance – Contractor Risk Managed Assets.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:21 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] The OSC POC has supplied all of the procedures, policies, and plans at the start of the assessment. One of the assessors notes that some of the documents have very recent approval dates, while others have been in place for several years based on the document history.

In order to ensure the review of this evidence is sufficient, what is the BEST step to validate the sufficiency of these documents?

A. Examine the documents to determine if they are complete.

B. Examine if the procedure in question replaced another document.

C. Interview OSC team members who should be using the procedure.

D. Interview people who hold leadership roles named in the documents.

Answer: C

Explanation
The Interview assessment method is used to validate whether procedures and policies are actually being implemented and followed by the personnel who use them. Even if the documents are dated correctly, assessors must confirm their operational use.

Extract:

“Interviews with personnel are used to verify that documented policies, plans, and procedures are actually implemented in daily practice.”

Thus, interviewing OSC team members who use the procedures provides the strongest validation. Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP); Assessment Methods (Examine, Interview, Test, Observe).

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:22 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] During an assessment, the Lead Assessor determines certain assets to be in-scope which the OSC had considered out-of-scope.

The CCA should reply that for assets to be considered out-of-scope they:

A. Provide security protections to CUI assets.

B. Do not provide security protections for CUI assets.

C. Can, but are not intended to, process, store, or transmit CUI.

D. Are not required to be physically or logically separated from CUI assets.

Answer: B

Explanation
The CMMC Scoping Guidance specifies that Out-of-Scope Assets are those that neither process, store, nor transmit CUI, and do not provide security protections for CUI assets.

Extract:

“Out-of-Scope assets are those that cannot process, store, or transmit CUI, and do not provide security protections for CUI assets.”

Thus, the correct answer is B.

Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance, Asset Categories.

Question #:23 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] While onsite conducting a CMMC Level 2 assessment at a small architecture firm that handles DoD construction contracts, the client offers a list of personnel for interviews. To answer questions regarding visitor access controls, which personnel would be MOST appropriate for interviewing?

A. System Administrator

B. Front-desk Receptionist

C. Administrative Assistant

D. Senior Architecture Partner

Answer: B

Explanation
Visitor access control (PE.L2-3.10.3 and PE.L2-3.10.4) typically involves procedures at entry points. The front-desk receptionist is the staff member most directly involved in logging, controlling, and monitoring visitor access. While system admins and partners handle IT and business operations, they do not control physical visitor access day-to-day.

Exact extracts:

“Assessment Method – Interview: personnel responsible for visitor access control (e.g., reception staff, security desk staff).”

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if visitor access is identified, logged, escorted, and monitored.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: System admins focus on IT, not visitor management.

C: Administrative assistants generally perform clerical tasks, not visitor logging.

D: Senior partners may approve contracts but are not directly responsible for visitor control. References:

Question #:24 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An organization has contracted with a third party for system maintenance and support. The third-party personnel all work remotely. Which of the following should an assessor assure is in place?

A. Only third-party personnel can perform system maintenance functions.

B. Third-party personnel need to be identified and monitored while performing maintenance.

C. The number of third-party personnel who can access the organization’s systems concurrently is limited.

D. Remote access to systems used by the third party for maintenance functions is terminated automatically based on a defined set of criteria.

Answer: D

Explanation
CMMC requires that remote maintenance sessions be terminated after use or after a defined period of inactivity. This ensures third-party maintenance access does not remain open and uncontrolled, preventing unauthorized persistence.

Exact Extracts:

MA.L2-3.7.5: “Require multifactor authentication and terminate remote maintenance sessions after each session or after a defined period of inactivity.”

Assessment Guide clarifies: “Assessors should confirm remote maintenance sessions are automatically terminated using technical means.”

NIST SP 800-171A Objective: “Test maintenance session termination after a set time of inactivity or completion of task.”

Why other options are not correct:

A: Limiting maintenance to third parties only is not a requirement. Internal staff may also perform maintenance.

B: Identification and monitoring are important, but the specific control required here is termination of remote sessions.

C: Limiting the number of personnel is not mandated by CMMC.

Question #:25 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC is preparing for an assessment and wants to gather evidence that will be used by the Lead Assessor to determine the scope of the assessment. The OSC currently operates a hybrid network, with part of their infrastructure at their physical location and part of their infrastructure in a cloud environment.

What evidence should the OSC collect that would assist the Lead Assessor in determining cloud and hybrid environment constraints?

A. Subnetworks list

B. System inventory

C. Company-owned hardware list

D. Cloud Service Provider’s Customer Responsibility Matrix

Answer: D

Explanation
For hybrid and cloud environments, the Customer Responsibility Matrix is the critical artifact. It identifies which security responsibilities are handled by the CSP and which remain with the OSC, directly impacting scope.

Extract:

“The OSC must provide responsibility matrices or equivalent documentation that clearly delineates which security controls are the responsibility of the provider and which are retained by the OSC.”

This is necessary for the Lead Assessor to define assessment scope boundaries.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2; Scoping Guidance for Cloud and Hybrid Environments.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:26 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] The OSC’s network consists of a single unmanaged switch that connects all devices, including OT equipment which cannot run a vendor-supported operating system. The OSC correctly scoped the OT equipment as a Specialized Asset, listed it in their inventory and SSP, and provided a network diagram showing plans to isolate the OT and apply additional security measures. What information does the Lead Assessor still require to ensure compliance?

A. Installation and configuration documentation for the OT to ensure it was correctly built

B. Wording in the scoping document detailing how the OT adheres to all other applicable CMMC practices

C. Wording in the SSP detailing how the OT is managed using the OSC’s risk-based security policies, procedures, and practices

D. Evidence that the network isolation is completed by the end of the assessment as well as supporting evidence for all other applicable CMMC practices

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CMMC Scoping Guidance – Specialized Assets): Specialized Assets (e. g., OT, IoT, GFE, test equipment) are not exempt from CMMC practices. OSCs must provide:

Documented identification in SSP/inventory, Justification of specialized handling, Evidence that risk-based security measures are implemented.

Why D is Correct: Assessors must see evidence that isolation is actually implemented (not just

planned), plus supporting artifacts showing how remaining applicable practices are addressed

(monitoring, inventory, access, etc.). Planned measures alone are insufficient.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Installation/config builds do not show operational isolation.

B: Scoping statements alone do not demonstrate implementation.

C: SSP language is descriptive but must be supported by implementation evidence. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:27 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC is presenting evidence of its fulfillment of CM.L2-3.4.1: System Baselining. It provides:

System inventory records showing additions/removals of machines,

Software inventory showing installations/removals, and

A system component installation plan with software needs and user specifications.

What other documentation MUST the company present to illustrate compliance with CM.L2-3.4.1?

A. Documentation of the physical safeguards protecting the “gold” baseline images

B. Documentation of a formal baseline review integrated with a system development lifecycle

C. Documentation of any authorized deviations from the system baselines for end-user computers

D. Documentation of a formal chain of custody for new hardware on which baselines will be installed

Answer: C

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: CM.L2-3.4.1 — “Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system development life cycles.”

Why C is Correct: Baseline management requires documenting and tracking authorized deviations to ensure systems remain consistent with approved baselines. Evidence must show the OSC manages exceptions as part of its configuration management process.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Physical safeguards protect images but do not demonstrate baseline management.

B: Reviews may be helpful, but deviations are explicitly required documentation.

D: Chain of custody applies to asset tracking, not baseline management.

Question #:28 - [CMMC Assessment Process] An OSC has contracted a C3PAO to perform a Level 2 Assessment. As the Lead Assessor is analyzing the assessment requirements, it is found that the OSC does not have a document detailing the assessment scope. How can this problem BEST be fixed?

A. The Assessment Team is supposed to generate the document before moving forward.

B. The CCA tells the OSC they must provide the document before the assessment can begin.

C. The OSC and the Lead Assessor jointly create the document at the beginning of the assessment.

D. The Lead Assessor can regulate the assessment and create/adjust the document moving forward.

Answer: B

Explanation
The OSC is responsible for providing the scoping documentation before the assessment begins. The assessor validates the scoping documentation but does not create it on behalf of the OSC. If the OSC cannot provide scope documentation, the assessment cannot proceed.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Scoping Guide: “The OSC must prepare and provide scoping documentation, including

network diagrams, asset inventories, and SSP, prior to assessment.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “The assessment team validates scoping documentation; it is not the

responsibility of the C3PAO or assessor to create the OSC’s scope.” Why other options are not correct:

A: Incorrect — assessment teams validate but do not generate scoping documents.

C: Joint creation is not allowed; OSC must own and prepare documentation.

D: Lead Assessor cannot create scope; must rely on OSC’s provided documentation. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: Pre-assessment scoping requirements (pp. 6–8). CMMC Assessment Scope – Level 2, Version 2.13: OSC responsibilities.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:29 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

A CCA is assessing the implementation of the Incident Reporting practice. To validate the control, what MUST the CCA ensure about the OSC?

A. Incidents are tracked and documented

B. Incident sources are configured and tuned

C. Law enforcement officials are automatically notified during an incident

D. Forensic investigations are performed to determine the impact of the incident

Answer: A

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: IR.L2-3.6.1 — “Establish an operational incident-handling capability for organizational systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities.”

Validation Expectation: For this practice, the CCA must confirm that the OSC:

Tracks incidents consistently, Documents incident details (who, what, when, where, and how), and Maintains incident records to support analysis and corrective action.

Why A is Correct: Tracking and documenting incidents demonstrates that the OSC has an operational incident-handling capability and provides objective evidence of detection, response, and lessons learned.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

B (Sources configured/tuned): Helpful for detection, but not sufficient by itself.

C (Law enforcement notified): This may occur in certain cases, but it is not required by CMMC Level 2.

D (Forensics): Deep forensic investigation may be useful, but CMMC requires incident response capability, not mandatory forensic-level activities.

Question #:30 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] While scoping the assessment, the assessor learns that the OSC uses various cloud-based solutions sporadically as part of its normal course of business. The OSC states that most business is conducted on premises and that only a small amount of business uses the cloud. The OSC thinks the cloud is only used for system backups, but there are isolated exceptions.

Are the data provided sufficient to determine that the OSC limits connection to external information systems?

A. No, the OSC stated most of its business is on-premises.

B. No, the OSC did not fully define the extent external connections are used.

C. Yes, the OSC confirmed that external connections occur.

D. Yes, the OSC confirmed that external connections occur for system backups.

Answer: B

Explanation
To scope connections to external systems, the OSC must fully define all external connections — not just general statements about "small use" or "backups." Incomplete or vague descriptions are not sufficient for scoping.

Extract:

“The OSC must identify and define the extent of all external connections that support processing, storage, or transmission of CUI to determine scope.”

Thus, the data provided are not sufficient, because the OSC has not fully defined external connections. Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance – External Service Providers & External Connections.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:31 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] The Lead Assessor is planning to conduct an assessment for an OSC. The Assessor has been given a preliminary asset inventory list by the OSC. How would the Lead Assessor determine if any assets are out of-scope for the assessment?

A. All assets in an OSC’s inventory fall within the scope of the assessment and, as such, should be assessed against the CMMC practices.

B. None of the assets in an OSC’s inventory fall within the scope of the assessment and, as such, should not be assessed against the CMMC practices.

C. Assets cannot process, store, or transmit CUI because they are physically or logically separated from CUI assets, or they are inherently unable to do so.

D. Out-of-Scope Assets can process, store, or transmit CUI because they do not need to be physically or logically separated.

Answer: C

Explanation
According to the CMMC Scoping Guidance, assets are categorized based on whether they can process, store, or transmit Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), or if they are physically/logically separated or inherently unable to interact with CUI systems. Assets that cannot process, store, or transmit CUI and are properly segregated are considered Out-of-Scope.

Extract from CMMC Scoping Guidance:

“Out-of-Scope assets are those that cannot process, store, or transmit CUI because they are physically or logically separated from CUI assets, or they are inherently unable to do so.”

Thus, the Lead Assessor determines out-of-scope assets by confirming that they are either segregated from CUI systems or technically incapable of handling CUI.

Reference: CMMC 2.0 Scoping Guidance for Level 2 Assessments (Official CCA documentation).

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:32 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A Lead Assessor is conducting an assessment for an OSC. The Lead Assessor is collecting evidence regarding the OSC’s network separation techniques. Which technique would be considered a logical separation technique and would fall within the scope of the assessment?

A. Data loss alerting configured at the edge of the network containing CUI assets

B. Access limitation based on badge access assigned to employees based on role

C. Role-based access control within a properly implemented identity and access management tool

D. A proxy-configured firewall that prevents data from flowing along the physical connection path

Answer: C

Explanation
Logical separation refers to the use of technical and access control mechanisms (e.g., role-based access, IAM tools, VLANs) to enforce boundaries between different users, roles, or networks. In contrast, physical separation relies on distinct hardware or physical barriers. Role-based access control within an IAM solution is a textbook example of logical separation, and it is specifically called out in the CMMC/NIST context. Exact extracts:

“Logical separation may be achieved through the use of virtualization, encryption, or access control mechanisms such as role-based access controls.”

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: • separation of users and information types is enforced by physical or logical means.”

“Logical separation is implemented using technical solutions such as access control lists, firewalls configured by policy, or identity and access management solutions.”

Why the other options are incorrect:

A (Data loss alerting): This is monitoring, not separation.

B (Badge access): This is a physical access control, not logical separation.

D (Proxy-configured firewall): This is boundary protection/traffic control; depending on setup it may be physical or logical, but the scenario points to role-based IAM as the logical example.

Question #:33 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] During an assessment, the Assessment Team has identified, according to the SSP and network diagram, that there is a mission system that cannot be altered but that has privileged accounts which should have MFA applied. As it is not possible to deploy a typical type of MFA on the mission system, which of the following constitutes a sufficient second factor?

A. VPN access to the mission system

B. User access logs on the mission system

C. Badge access to the mission system room

D. Remote access logs on the mission system

Answer: C

Explanation
CMMC allows for compensating controls when technical limitations prevent direct application of MFA on certain systems. In such cases, a valid second factor can be a strong physical access control mechanism. Extract from IA.L2-3.5.3 (Use of multifactor authentication):

“Multifactor authentication can be implemented by combining something you know (e.g., password) with something you have (e.g., physical badge), or something you are (e.g., biometric). Physical access controls, such as badge-protected facilities, can serve as a compensating factor when direct MFA on the system is not technically possible.”

Therefore, badge access to the mission system room serves as a sufficient second factor.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, IA.L2-3.5.3.

Question #:34 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

A cloud-native OSC uses a vendor’s FedRAMP MODERATE authorized cloud environment for all aspects of their CUI needs (identity, email, file storage, office suite, etc.) as well as the vendor’s locally installable applications. The OSC properly configured the vendor’s cloud-based SIEM system to monitor all aspects of the cloud environment. The OSC’s SSP documents SI.L2-3.14.7: Identify Unauthorized Use, defining authorized use and referencing procedures for identifying unauthorized use.

How should the Certified Assessor score this practice?

A. NOT MET because logs from physical infrastructure are not captured by the SIEM.

B. NOT MET because locally installable applications from a cloud-native environment are not allowed.

C. MET because being cloud-native is a great way to contain risk to a vendor’s environment.

D. MET because the cloud SIEM is configured to monitor all of the vendor’s cloud environment.

Answer: D

Explanation
SI.L2-3.14.7 requires the OSC to identify unauthorized use of organizational systems. The OSC meets this requirement by configuring the FedRAMP MODERATE provider’s SIEM to monitor their entire cloud environment where CUI is processed.

Extract:

“Organizations must employ monitoring mechanisms to detect unauthorized use of information systems. Cloud-native environments with FedRAMP authorized monitoring meet the requirement when properly configured and documented.”

Thus, the practice is MET because the SIEM covers the cloud environment.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, SI.L2-3.14.7.

Question #:35 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

An Assessor is evaluating controls put in place by an OSC to restrict the use of privileged accounts. The Assessor interviews privileged users and confirms that the OSC has both a policy and specific procedures governing the use of privileged accounts for security functions. What else could the Assessor evaluate to validate the assertions made by the interviewed OSC staff?

A. Examine the system architecture of the OSC to identify privileged accounts

B. Test the processes for non-privileged accounts to perform privileged functions

C. Examine the procedure assigning privileged roles to non-privileged functions

D. Test the processes for privileged accounts with privileged users

Answer: A

Explanation
For AC.L2-3.1.7 (Restrict Use of Privileged Accounts), it is not enough to rely on interviews or documented procedures. The assessor must also Examine technical evidence to ensure that privileged accounts exist as described and are properly controlled. Reviewing system architecture, account listings, and role assignments validates that privileged access aligns with policy and that inappropriate assignments do not exist.

Exact extracts:

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: privileged accounts are identified; privileged functions are restricted to privileged accounts; and use of privileged accounts is monitored.”

“Assessment Methods – Examine: account management policy; system architecture documentation; system security plan; privileged account listings.”

“Assessment Methods – Test: attempt to use non-privileged accounts to execute privileged functions.” Expanded explanation:

Assessors typically proceed in layers:

Interview: Confirm staff knowledge of policy and practice.

Examine: Verify account structures in system architecture or AD group membership lists. This ensures the number and type of privileged accounts match staff descriptions.

Test (if required): Confirm that non-privileged users cannot perform privileged actions.

Why other options are incorrect:

B: Testing non-privileged accounts is useful but is not the next immediate validation step after confirming policy/procedures. Examination comes first.

C: This phrasing implies giving privileged roles to non-privileged functions, which would itself be a finding.

D: Testing with privileged users verifies activity monitoring, but not whether privileged accounts are properly scoped.

Question #:36 - [CMMC Assessment Process] The Lead Assessor is conducting an assessment for an OSC. The Lead Assessor has finished collecting and examining evidence from the assessment.

Based on this information, what is the NEXT logical step?

A. Develop an assessment plan.

B. Deliver recommended assessment results.

C. Generate final recommended assessment results.

D. Determine and record initial practice scores.

Answer: D

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) defines the logical order:

After collecting and examining evidence, the next step is to determine and record initial practice scores (MET, NOT MET, or NA).

Only after practice scoring is completed are findings validated and aggregated into final recommended results.

Extract:

“Following evidence collection and review, assessors determine and record the practice status (MET/NOT MET/NA) before compiling results into final recommendations.”

Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Phase 2.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:37 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC has a hardware and software list used to manage company assets. Which is the BEST evidence to show the OSC is managing the system baseline?

A. Media protection

B. Physical protection

C. Configuration management

D. Identification and authentication policy

Answer: C

Explanation
System baselines are part of Configuration Management (CM). Maintaining an inventory of hardware and software is important, but the evidence of managing baselines lies in the configuration management process, which establishes and documents standard system configurations, approved software, and change control . The CMMC practice CM.L2-3.4.1 requires the OSC to establish and maintain baseline configurations. Exact extracts:

“Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and maintained as part of configuration management.”

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: baseline configurations are established; baseline configurations are maintained.”

“Potential Assessment Methods – Examine: configuration management policy; documented baseline configuration; inventory of system components.”

Expanded explanation:

Hardware/software lists show what exists, but without baseline control they do not demonstrate effective management.

Configuration management evidence includes: CM policies, baselines for operating systems, software versions, patch levels, and configuration checklists.

This ensures that unauthorized changes or unapproved software do not deviate from the security posture. Why the other options are incorrect:

A (Media protection): Relates to storage devices and handling, not baselines.

B (Physical protection): Relates to facility and hardware security, not configuration.

D (Identification and authentication policy): Addresses user access, not baseline configuration. References:

Question #:38 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

In order to perform an interview, the Lead Assessor MUST ensure interview questions are:

A. Yes/no questions

B. Asked by any member of the OSC’s team

C. Asked to those who implement, perform, or support the practices

D. Asked with multiple people simultaneously to limit the number of interviews needed

Answer: C

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: CAP – Interview Guidance.

Why C is Correct: Interviews must be directed to personnel responsible for implementing, performing, or supporting practices to ensure accurate and objective evidence is collected. Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Yes/no questions do not provide sufficient evidence detail.

B: OSC personnel cannot ask themselves assessment questions; only assessors may conduct interviews.

D: Group interviews may be used in some cases, but CAP stresses targeted interviews for evidence reliability.

Question #:39 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] A C3PAO is conducting a Level 2 assessment of a midsized construction contractor that does both private (commercial) and federal work. The contractor’s documentation states that all CUI flows through a single building on their office campus and is logically, physically, and administratively isolated from the rest of the environment. Why might an assessor request access to assess controls within a building or area not listed as inscope in the documentation?

A. If the assessor sees personnel carrying locked cases into the other building or area

B. If the OSC has an underground passageway connecting the CUI building to a non-CUI building

C. If network diagrams indicate the commercial and federal sectors share a single Internet connection

D.

D. If Human Resources that supports both commercial and federal sectors sits in the other building or area

Answer: C

Explanation
A shared Internet connection indicates that Security Protection Assets (SPAs) are present and serving both the CUI environment and other parts of the enterprise. SPAs are always in-scope regardless of where they are located, because they provide security protections for CUI. Therefore, if documentation or diagrams show that the commercial and federal environments share a single Internet connection, the assessor must request access to the other building to confirm proper implementation and isolation.

Exact Extracts (from CMMC Assessor/Study documents):

“Security Protection Assets provide security functions or capabilities within the OSA’s CMMC Assessment Scope. Security Protection Assets are part of the CMMC Assessment Scope and are assessed against Level 2 security requirements that are relevant to the capabilities provided.”

“Contractor Risk Managed Assets are not required to be physically or logically separated from CUI Assets… If documentation or other findings raise questions about these assets, the assessor can conduct a limited check to identify deficiencies.”

“Separation… is required only for Out-of-Scope Assets. Isolation can be achieved… by implementing subnetworks with firewalls or other boundary protection devices.”

“The CMMC Assessment Scope includes all assets in the OSA’s environment that will be assessed… OSAs will be required to provide a network diagram of the CMMC Assessment Scope to facilitate scoping discussions during pre-assessment.”

“An OSC can obtain a Level 2 certification assessment for an entire enterprise network or for a specific enclave(s), depending upon how the CMMC Assessment Scope is defined…”

Why the other options are not correct:

A (locked cases): Physical movement of materials does not establish scope. Scoping is determined by CUI flow and security protection assets, not incidental observation of personnel activities.

B (underground passageway): Physical tunnels or building connections do not affect scope unless they result in shared IT/security functions.

D (HR location): HR is not a SPA because it does not provide security functions to protect CUI. Unless HR systems process or store CUI directly, they remain out of scope.

CMMC Assessment Scope – Level 2, Version 2.13 (Scoping Guide): Asset Categories, SPA definitions and examples; CRMA limited-check language; Separation requirements; network diagram requirements (pp. 3–13).

Question #:40 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles]

ESPs are exceptionally common today, given that many organizations are turning to secure cloud offerings to establish and maintain compliance. Integral to these relationships is a responsibility matrix, which defines who is responsible for specific items such as security. This can be a very complex assortment of taskings associated with federal compliance, but what is the MOST important thing to remember?

A. The ESP is technically not part of the DIB and has no responsibility to be CMMC compliant in its own right.

B. The CMMC Assessment Team will factor in any documentation provided by the ESP when evaluating the OSC for compliance.

C. The relationship of an OSC with an ESP is a partnership and the CMMC Assessment will evaluate the ESP at the same time as the OSC.

D. Only the OSC is being assessed for compliance, and while the ESP may have a lot of responsibilities in the matrix, the OSC is ultimately responsible for meeting the requirements as specified by government mandates.

Answer: D

Explanation
The OSC (Organization Seeking Certification) is always responsible for meeting CMMC requirements, regardless of what responsibilities are shared or outsourced to an ESP. ESPs can provide inherited practices (e. g., FedRAMP Moderate for cloud CUI), but the OSC remains accountable for compliance under government mandates.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “The OSC is the entity being assessed. While an ESP may provide inherited practices, the OSC retains ultimate responsibility for compliance.”

Scoping Guide: “External Service Providers may meet requirements on behalf of the OSC; however, it is the OSC that is assessed and must demonstrate sufficiency of evidence.”

Why other options are not correct:

A: Incorrect — ESPs that process CUI must meet FedRAMP Moderate equivalency, even if not directly assessed for CMMC.

B: While true, factoring documentation does not override that OSC remains accountable. C: ESPs are not assessed at the same time as the OSC; only the OSC receives certification.

Question #:41 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A company receives data that they suspect is CUI, but it is not marked as such. What is an acceptable way for the company to handle unmarked potential CUI?

A. Treat all data as CUI even if not marked.

B. If data are not marked, then they are not CUI.

C. Have a procedure for deleting unlabeled data.

D. Have a procedure for proper handling of unlabeled data.

Answer: D

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Guide (Level 2) requires organizations to have a documented procedure for the identification and handling of unmarked potential CUI. The DoD guidance specifies that contractors cannot assume unmarked data is not CUI; instead, they must have a process to ensure unmarked potential CUI is handled properly until its classification is clarified.

Extract from Assessment Guide:

“Organizations must establish procedures for the handling of unmarked data that is suspected of being CUI. These procedures should define how unmarked information is protected until such time its status can be determined.”

Therefore, the correct answer is to have a procedure for proper handling of unlabeled data.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide, Level 2, CUI Handling Practices.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:42 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] During an assessment, the OSC person being interviewed explains the process for escorting visitors. The individual states that while all visitors are escorted, occasionally a vendor may need access to a small room with only one door and limited standing room. In these cases, the escort sits outside the room and observes the vendor completing the work. Is this practice in line with the escort policy?

A. No, the escort is not allowed to sit down

B. No, the escort must always be in the same room

C. Yes, since the visitor can only use a single entry

D. Yes, so long as the visitor’s actions can still be viewed by the escort

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: PE.L2-3.10.3 — “Control physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and operating environments.”

Why D is Correct: Escort requirements are met as long as the visitor’s actions are continuously observed and controlled. The escort does not need to be physically inside the same room if direct observation is possible.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Escort posture (sitting/standing) is irrelevant.

B: Same-room presence is not required by CMMC/NIST SP 800-171.

C: A single entry point helps, but observation is the requirement.

Question #:43 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] An OSC uses a colocation facility to house its CUI assets. The colocation restricts access to the data center via keycard and requires all entrants to sign in and out. The OSC’s cage and cabinets are further secured with keys accessible only to OSC-authorized personnel.

In order to assess physical controls, the CCA should:

A. Physically visit the colocation facility to determine the effectiveness of controls.

B. Evaluate the colocation facility security process as listed in the service agreement.

C. Physically visit the colocation facility to determine the effectiveness of controls and review the OSC’s process for maintaining access to the keys.

D. Evaluate the colocation facility security process as listed in the service agreement and review the OSC’s process for maintaining access to the keys.

Answer: C

Explanation
The Physical Protection (PE) practices require both direct assessor observation of security controls and verification of how the OSC manages access to its cages/cabinets.

Extract:

“Assessors should observe and verify the effectiveness of physical access controls and confirm the OSC’s processes for maintaining control over restricted areas and assets.”

Thus, the best option is to physically visit the facility and review OSC’s key access management process. Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, PE Practices.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:44 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] The OSC has not implemented cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI during transmission, citing the use of alternative physical safeguards.

Which of the following is NOT an alternative physical safeguard in this scenario?

A. Trusted couriers

B. Lockable casings

C. Physical access site monitoring

D. Tamper protections technologies

Answer: D

Explanation
Acceptable physical safeguards in lieu of encryption (in limited cases) include trusted couriers, locked containers, and monitored physical transport. “Tamper protection technologies” are not recognized as an acceptable alternative safeguard for protecting CUI in transit.

Extract:

“Physical safeguards such as trusted couriers, locked containers, and controlled site monitoring may substitute for cryptographic protections when encryption is not feasible. Other measures not defined (e.g., tamper protection) do not satisfy the requirement.”

Thus, D is NOT an acceptable safeguard.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, SC.L2-3.13.8.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:45 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

A Lead Assessor is preparing to conduct a Level 2 Assessment for an OSC. The assessor already determined the assessment scope and systems included. In addition, the assessor requests:

Results of the most recent OSC self-assessment or any pre-assessments by an RPO,

The System Security Plan (SSP), and

A list of all OSC staff who play a role in in-scope procedures.

Based on this information, which item would the assessor MOST LIKELY request when preparing to conduct a Level 2 Assessment?

A. A list of objectives

B. A manual for each system

C. A preliminary list of the anticipated evidence

D. A list of assets that are determined to be out-of-scope

Answer: C

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) requires the Lead Assessor to develop an Assessment Plan that specifies anticipated evidence to be provided by the OSC. This preliminary evidence list ensures that OSC staff understand what policies, procedures, logs, and technical configurations must be available during the assessment. Without this, the assessment may stall due to missing documentation.

Exact extracts:

“The Lead Assessor coordinates with the OSC to develop an evidence list of artifacts anticipated for review.”

“The assessment plan must include a schedule of interviews, site visits, and anticipated evidence.” “Preliminary evidence identification is critical to reduce assessment delays and ensure assessor readiness.”

Expanded explanation:

This step bridges planning and execution:

Scope has already been set.

Now, the evidence (SSPs, policies, audit logs, diagrams, etc.) must be identified.

Out-of-scope assets are part of scoping, not this planning stage.

System manuals are not required by CMMC, and “list of objectives” refers to assessor methodology, not OSC preparation.

Why other options are incorrect:

A: Objectives come from the practice requirements themselves, not something requested from the OSC. B: System manuals are not required artifacts for CMMC.

D: Out-of-scope assets were already determined during scoping.

Question #:46 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC seeking Level 2 certification is reviewing the physical security of their building. Currently, the building manager unlocks and locks the doors for business operations. The OSC would like the ability to automatically unlock the door for authorized personnel, track access individually, and maintain access history for all personnel. The BEST approach is for the OSC to:

A. Maintain a list of authorized personnel and assign them a building key.

B. Maintain security cameras to continuously monitor access to the building.

C. Install a badge system and require each individual to use their badge to gain entry to the building.

D. Install a keypad system and require the entry code to be changed when an individual leaves the company.

Answer: C

Explanation
CMMC Level 2 requires the ability to control and monitor physical access to systems and facilities containing CUI. The best practice is a badge-based access control system, which provides individual accountability, access tracking, and historical audit records. Keys and keypads do not provide individual traceability. Cameras alone do not prevent unauthorized entry.

Exact Extracts (official CMMC Assessor/Study documents):

PE.L2-3.10.1: “Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.”

PE.L2-3.10.3: “Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.”

PE.L2-3.10.5: “Access records must be maintained.”

CMMC Assessment Guide clarifies that acceptable methods include badging systems with individual accountability for traceability.

Why the other options are not correct:

A (keys): Keys do not provide audit logs or individual accountability.

B (cameras): Monitoring alone is insufficient; prevention and control are required.

D (keypads): Shared codes do not provide unique traceability or access history per user.

Question #:47 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An assessor reviews the OSC’s data protection policy, which requires full disk encryption on company laptops. While interviewing employees, the assessor learns that employees sometimes access data while teleworking on laptops that do not have full disk encryption.

How should the assessor view the implementation of the OSC’s policy?

A. Acceptable because it requires full disk encryption of company laptops.

B. Insufficient because there are teleworking instances where the policy is not followed.

C. Acceptable as long as an equivalent technical safeguard is implemented for all teleworking scenarios.

D. Insufficient because full disk encryption is not required for laptops to comply with CMMC requirements.

Answer: B

Explanation
The Assessment Guide emphasizes that a policy is insufficient unless it is implemented consistently across all applicable assets. Evidence from interviews showing exceptions means the practice is NOT MET. Extract:

“Policies must not only exist but must also be enforced and implemented consistently. Exceptions indicate non-compliance.”

Thus, the correct answer is B.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2; Assessment Methodology.

Question #:48 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] When a new employee is issued a laptop, only the user’s credentials need to be set up. According to the IT department, the IT manager is the only person who can change laptop setup and user privileges. What documentation should be examined to determine if this is the case?

A. System audit logs

B. Inventory records

C. Acceptable use policy

D. Remote access procedures

Answer: A

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: AC.L2-3.1.5 — “Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.”

Why A is Correct: Audit logs document when privileged functions (such as account creation, privilege changes, or configuration changes) occur, who performed them, and whether access control restrictions are enforced. Reviewing logs is the only way to confirm the IT manager alone has the capability.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

B (Inventory records): Shows ownership, not privilege changes.

C (Acceptable use): Policy guidance, not enforcement evidence.

D (Remote access): Deals with remote connections, not privilege management.

Question #:49 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC has two business locations. At each location, the OSC has a wireless guest network to which nonOSC employees are allowed access. The guest network is not password protected and it connects devices within the local OSC’s LAN. Based on this information, does the OSC meet the requirements of Level 2 for network access restriction?

A. No, the OSC needs to go through an additional assessment.

B. No, the OSC has not met the network access restriction requirements.

C. Yes, there are no network access restriction requirements.

D. Yes, the OSC has met the network access restriction requirements.

Answer: B

Explanation
CMMC Level 2 requires that network access to CUI systems be restricted to authorized users and devices . A guest network without password protection that connects directly into the LAN violates AC.L2-3.1.3 (Access Enforcement) and SC.L2-3.13.16 (Cryptographic protection) because unauthorized users may access OSC systems and CUI indirectly.

Exact Extracts:

AC.L2-3.1.3: “Control the flow of CUI by enforcing access restrictions.”

SC.L2-3.13.16: “Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect confidentiality of CUI during

transmission.”

Assessment Guide: “Guest wireless networks must be segmented and controlled to prevent

unauthorized access to internal networks containing CUI.” Why other options are not correct:

A: Additional assessment is irrelevant — issue is failure to meet requirements.

C/D: False — requirements clearly exist, and the OSC’s current setup fails them.

Question #:50 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] A CCA is assessing the concept of least functionality in accordance with CM.L2-3.4.6: Least Functionality. Which method is the LEAST LIKELY to be useful as an assessment technique?

A. Interview personnel with information security responsibilities.

B. Interview personnel with application development responsibilities.

C. Interview personnel who wrote the configuration management policy.

D. Interview personnel with security configuration management responsibilities.

Answer: C

Explanation
To validate least functionality, the assessor must evaluate implementation (via security staff, admins, developers). Interviewing the policy author provides limited value since it does not confirm whether the policy is implemented in practice.

Extract:

“Assessors should confirm least functionality through interviews with individuals responsible for system configuration, security, and implementation. Policy documentation authors alone are not sufficient evidence.” Thus, interviewing the policy writer is least useful.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, CM.L2-3.4.6.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:51 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] During an assessment interview, the interviewee states that anyone can connect to the company Wi-Fi without prior approval. Within which domains is the Wi-Fi configuration covered?

A. Media Protection (MP), Access Control (AC), and Physical Protection (PE)

B. Identification and Authentication (IA), Media Protection (MP), and System and Information Integrity (SI)

C. Access Control (AC), Identification and Authentication (IA), and System and Communications Protection (SC)

D. System and Communications Protection (SC), System and Information Integrity (SI), and Physical Protection (PE)

Answer: C

Explanation
Access Control (AC): Wi-Fi access must be restricted to authorized users and devices. CMMC Level 2 incorporates NIST SP 800-171 AC requirements to limit and control access to systems and resources. Identification and Authentication (IA): Wireless access requires authentication to ensure only authorized individuals/devices can connect (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise, certificates, or strong passwords). System and Communications Protection (SC): Wi-Fi encryption and secure configuration protect data-in-transit from interception or unauthorized disclosure.

Why Other Options Are Incorrect:

A (MP, AC, PE): Media protection and physical protection are not primary domains for Wi-Fi configuration.

B (IA, MP, SI): Media protection and system/information integrity do not directly address Wi-Fi security.

D (SC, SI, PE): Physical and integrity controls are not central to wireless access security.

Question #:52 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] The Lead Assessor is ready to complete planning by developing the assessment schedule. The Lead Assessor and the OSC Assessment Official discuss the Assessment Team members.

What MUST be submitted to the Cyber-AB before the assessment?

A. Individual travel plans

B. Non-disclosure agreements

C. Verified NIST SP 800-171 assessor qualifications

D. Absence of Conflict of Interest and Confirmation Statement

Answer: D

Explanation
The CAP requires that prior to the assessment, the Lead Assessor submit documentation confirming that Assessment Team members have no conflicts of interest and meet qualification requirements. This is recorded through the Absence of Conflict of Interest and Confirmation Statement.

Extract:

“Before assessment initiation, the C3PAO must provide confirmation to the Cyber-AB that all Assessment Team members have declared absence of conflict of interest and are confirmed to participate.”

Thus, the required submission is the Absence of Conflict of Interest and Confirmation Statement.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Pre-Assessment Planning.

Question #:53 - [CMMC Assessment Process] The Lead Assessor is compiling the assessment results, which must contain the status for each of the applicable practices. Some practices have been placed in the limited practice deficiency correction program. Multiple areas have been reviewed, including HQ, host units, and a specific enclave.

In order to properly report the findings, the Lead Assessor MUST:

A. Identify items that were moved to the POA&M.

B. Confirm the final findings are aggregated to the OSC level.

C. Record the agreements made with the OSC Assessment Official.

D. Ensure the report includes all of the evidence that has been collected.

Answer: B

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) requires that results be reported at the OSC level. While findings may be gathered from enclaves or units, the final reporting must be aggregated and scored across the entire OSC assessment boundary.

Extract:

“Final recommended assessment results must be consolidated and reported at the OSC level, regardless of assessment locations or enclaves.”

Thus, the Lead Assessor must ensure aggregation to the OSC level.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Reporting Results.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:54 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] Testing is one assessment method the Lead Assessor may choose depending on the assessment scope and evidence provided by the OSC. During the Plan Phase, the Lead Assessor and OSC POC agree on who the people are that are involved in a particular practice so that it could be tested if determined appropriate. During the discussion, the OSC POC tells the Lead Assessor that the production system is in use and cannot be stopped for the testing to take place but offers a mirrored system for testing. The Lead Assessor decides:

A. Only to test the processes conducted by the supporting groups

B. Only to test the Customer Matrices that are available

C. Not to perform testing as a mirrored system is not an acceptable substitute for the production system

D. To ask the OSC for evidence that a mirrored system is exactly the same as the production system to conduct testing

Answer: D

Explanation
Testing may be performed on a mirrored system if the OSC can demonstrate that it is configured identically to the production system. The assessor must confirm equivalency through objective evidence before accepting test results.

Exact Extracts:

NIST SP 800-171A: “Test assessment method involves exercising assessment objects under specified

conditions… mirrored or replicated systems may be used if validated as equivalent.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “If production systems cannot be tested, assessors may accept mirrored

systems provided evidence demonstrates that the mirrored environment is representative of the

production system.”

Why the other options are not correct:

A/B: Testing must focus on systems and controls, not limited groups or customer matrices.

C: Incorrect — mirrored systems are acceptable if validated as equivalent.

D: Correct, as validation of equivalency is required.

Question #:55 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] A company has four waterjet machines with very limited computing capabilities. The company loads CUI onto these machines for machining parts and uses CUI as necessary for machining.

Should these waterjet machines be part of the CMMC Assessment?

A. No, these waterjet machines are Out-of-Scope Assets and do not need to be assessed.

B. Yes, these waterjet machines are CUI Assets that must be assessed because they handle CUI.

C. Yes, these waterjet machines are Specialized Assets that are within the scope of a CMMC Assessment.

D. No, these waterjet machines are Contractor Risk Managed Assets and do not need to be assessed.

Answer: C

Explanation
The CMMC Scoping Guidance defines Specialized Assets (e.g., OT, IoT, test equipment, manufacturing machines) that may process CUI but do not always meet traditional IT security requirements. These assets are still within scope and must be documented and assessed as Specialized Assets.

Extract:

“Specialized Assets are defined as operational technology, IoT, test equipment, and similar devices that may process CUI but cannot be secured in the same manner as standard assets. They remain in-scope for the assessment.”

Thus, waterjet machines are Specialized Assets in scope.

Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance – Specialized Assets.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:56 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

The OSC POC has prepared evidence from an internal pre-assessment for the C3PAO in preparation for a third-party assessment. The OSC POC has identified that there are several ESPs (External Service Providers) involved in protecting the security of the infrastructure. While reviewing the pre-assessment documentation regarding ESPs, the Lead Assessor will be looking for items that are:

A. Noted as inherited

B. Marked as requiring a waiver

C. Marked as NOT APPLICABLE

D. Noted as partially implemented

Answer: A

Explanation
When External Service Providers are used, the OSC can inherit practices from the ESP if sufficient evidence is provided (such as FedRAMP authorization or equivalent). The Lead Assessor must verify which controls are noted as inherited, as these are assessed differently from controls implemented directly by the OSC.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “An OSC may inherit practices from External Service Providers when those providers demonstrate equivalent compliance (e.g., FedRAMP Moderate for CUI).”

“Assessors must review documentation that identifies which practices are inherited, partially implemented, or implemented internally.”

CMMC Scoping Guide: “Inherited controls must be clearly documented by the OSC in the SSP.”

Why the other options are not correct:

B: Waivers are not part of CMMC assessments.

C: “Not Applicable” does not apply to ESP involvement; they either provide inherited practices or not.

D: “Partially implemented” indicates deficiencies, not proper inheritance. References:

Question #:57 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

Video monitoring is used by an OSC to help meet PE.L2-3.10.2: Monitor Facility. The OSC’s building has three external doors, each with badge access and a network-connected video camera above the door. The video cameras are connected to the same network as employee computers. The OSC contracted a local security company to provide surveillance services. The security company stores the recordings at its premises and requires access to the OSC’s network to manage the video cameras. Which factor is a clear negative finding for the OSC’s assessment?

A. Video surveillance needs to be of both private and public areas of the building

B. A non-certified third party accesses the OSC’s network to manage the cameras

C. Video surveillance alone does not satisfy the facility monitoring requirement of PE.L2-3.10.2

D. A non-certified third party’s data center may not store video recordings for a company authorized to process CUI

Answer: B

Explanation
The negative finding is that the OSC permits an uncertified external security provider to access the OSC’s internal network. This introduces unmanaged risk to the CUI environment. CMMC requires the OSC to control and monitor external service provider access. The storage of recordings externally is not inherently noncompliant if properly controlled, and video monitoring is a valid method of meeting PE.L2-3.10.2. The key failure is giving unmanaged third-party access.

Exact extracts:

“Monitor physical facility to detect and respond to physical security incidents.” (PE.L2-3.10.2)

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: monitoring is performed; unauthorized physical access is detected and responded to.”

“External service providers that connect into the OSC network are considered in-scope and must meet CMMC requirements or have equivalent authorization (e.g., FedRAMP).”

Why other options are incorrect:

A: Requirement does not mandate monitoring of both public and private areas.

C: Video surveillance is an acceptable facility monitoring method when properly implemented.

D: External storage can be acceptable if contractual safeguards and compliance are in place. References:

Question #:58 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] Different mechanisms can be used to protect information at rest. Which mechanism is MOST LIKELY to afford protection for information at rest?

A. Patching

B. File share

C. Secure offline storage

D. Cryptographic mechanisms

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: SC.L2-3.13.16 — “Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest.”

Why D is Correct: Cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., full-disk encryption, database encryption, file encryption) provide the strongest protection for information at rest by preventing unauthorized disclosure if systems or media are accessed.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A (Patching): Protects against vulnerabilities, but not specific to data-at-rest confidentiality.

B (File share): Provides a storage method, not protection.

C (Secure offline storage): Helps physically, but not sufficient for digital confidentiality without encryption.

Question #:59 - [CMMC Assessment Process] An Assessor is examining documents provided by the OSC POC. While reviewing them, the Assessor notes that several of the procedures have very current dates while the bulk do not. What should the Assessor do in order to decide if these new documents are acceptable as evidence?

A. Ensure the documents were approved by a senior-level manager.

B. Determine the outlined reasonableness of the procedures.

C. Determine if the people involved in writing the procedures are on the list of those who can be interviewed.

D. Set up an observation session to determine if the procedures are in use and people are knowledgeable of their deployment and use.

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CAP Evidence Standards): Evidence must be objective and demonstrate implementation. Newly created documentation may exist only for assessment purposes, so the assessor must validate whether the documented procedures are actually in practice.

Why D is Correct: Observation sessions confirm that personnel are knowledgeable about and actively following the documented procedures. This ensures the documents reflect actual implementation rather than being created solely for assessment.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Approval shows authority but does not prove procedures are implemented.

B: Subjective determination of “reasonableness” is not an approved assessment method.

C: Identifying authors does not validate implementation.

Question #:60 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] What should the Lead Assessor do to BEST ensure the evidence supplied effectively meets the intent of the standard for a practice?

A. Ensure the evidence for each objective under a practice is adequate.

B. Ensure the evidence is sufficient to meet the requirements for a practice.

C. Ensure the evidence is complete, validated, and can be mapped to the practice requirements.

D. Ensure the evidence covers all the scope and the identified organizations and corresponds to the practice and objectives.

Answer: C

Explanation
The CAP defines evidence evaluation requirements. Evidence must not only exist but must also be:

Complete (addresses all assessment objectives for the practice) Validated (verified by the assessor) Mapped to the practice requirements (traceable to objectives) Extract:

“The assessor must confirm that the evidence is complete, validated, and mapped directly to the practice requirements in order to conclude that a practice is MET.”

Question #:61 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] During a CMMC Assessment, the assessor is determining if the Escort Visitors practice is MET. Personnel with which of the following responsibilities would be MOST appropriate to interview?

A.

A. Repair and facilities maintenance

B. Local access control and information security

C. Physical access control and information security

D. Information technology management and operations

Answer: C

Explanation
The Escort Visitors practice falls under Physical and Environmental Protection (PE.L2-3.10.3), which requires organizations to escort visitors and monitor visitor activity. To validate this, the assessor should interview personnel responsible for physical access control (security guards, facility access managers) and information security (to confirm integration with CUI protection requirements).

Exact Extracts:

PE.L2-3.10.3: “Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.”

Assessment Guide: “Interview personnel responsible for physical access control and security

monitoring to confirm escort and visitor activity tracking.”

Assessment Objectives: Require evidence of visitor escorts, visitor logs, and monitoring practices. Why the other options are not correct:

A (Repair/maintenance): Not responsible for escort procedures.

B (Local access control only): Missing the information security link, which ensures visitors cannot

access CUI assets.

D (IT management): IT is not responsible for escorting visitors in physical spaces. References:

Question #:62 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] To meet AC.L2-3.1.5: Least Privilege, the following procedure is established:

All employees are given a basic (non-privileged) user account.

System Administrators are given a separate System Administrator account.

Database Administrators are given a separate Database Administrator account. Which steps should be added to BEST meet all of the standards for least privilege?

A. 4. Database Administrators use their Database Administrator accounts to perform privileged functions.

5. All users use their basic account for non-privileged functions.

B. 4. Database Administrators use their Database Administrator accounts to perform privileged functions.

5. Non-privileged users use their basic account for non-privileged functions.

C. 4. Database Administrators use the System Administrator accounts to perform privileged functions.

5. All other users use their basic account for all authorized functions.

D. 4. Database Administrators use the System Administrator accounts to perform privileged functions.

5. Non-privileged users use their basic account for all authorized functions.

Answer: A

Explanation
Least privilege requires users to perform privileged functions only with privileged accounts and to use their basic (non-privileged) accounts for general activity. This prevents unnecessary exposure of elevated rights and limits attack surfaces. Database Administrators must use their DBA accounts only for DBA tasks, and all users must use their basic accounts for non-privileged tasks.

Exact Extracts:

AC.L2-3.1.5: “Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.”

Assessment Objectives: Require separate accounts for privileged and non-privileged activities. Assessment Guide Clarification: “Privileged accounts should be used only for privileged functions; standard accounts must be used for all other activities.”

Why the other options are not correct:

B: States “non-privileged users use their basic account” but does not explicitly require all users (including admins) to use their basic account for non-privileged tasks.

C/D: Incorrectly assign System Administrator accounts to Database Administrators, which violates least privilege (admins must only have the access needed for their role).

Question #:63 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] When assessing an environment, the CCA determines that CUI is contained within an IoT device. Which statement MUST be true?

A. The IoT device is a Contractor Risk Managed Asset.

B. The IoT device must be accurately documented within the SSP.

C. An IoT device may not be utilized to process, store, or transmit CUI.

D. Access provisioned to the IoT device must be done in accordance with AC.L2-3.1.1: Limit System Access.

Answer: B

Explanation
When an IoT device processes, stores, or transmits CUI, it is categorized as a CUI Asset (not CRMA). All inscope assets must be documented in the System Security Plan (SSP). The SSP must identify how the asset is managed, secured, and integrated into the OSC’s environment.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Scoping Guide: “All CUI Assets must be identified and described in the SSP.”

“Specialized Assets (including IoT) must be documented in the SSP if they process, store, or transmit

CUI.”

“Contractor Risk Managed Assets do not include assets that process, store, or transmit CUI.” Why other options are not correct:

A: Incorrect, because an IoT device with CUI cannot be a CRMA.

C: Incorrect, IoT can process CUI if properly secured and documented.

D: While true in general (AC control applies), the mandatory requirement is accurate SSP

documentation.

Question #:64 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] The team is assessing an OSC that uses the cloud for hosting its online services. Which of the following is NOT important for the assessor to consider?

A. Devices connecting to the system are authorized.

B. Processes acting on behalf of a user are authenticated.

C. Users are authorized as a prerequisite to system access.

D. FIPS encryption is authenticated as a prerequisite to system access.

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: SC.L2-3.13.8 (Cryptographic protection of communications) and IA.L2-3.5. x (Identification and authentication).

Why D is Correct: Encryption must be validated as FIPS 140-2/3 compliant but is never “authenticated as a prerequisite to access.” Authentication applies to users, devices, and processes, not cryptographic modules themselves.

Why A, B, C are Correct Considerations:

Devices must be authorized before connecting.

Processes acting on behalf of a user must be authenticated.

Users must be authorized prior to access. These are all directly mapped to AC and IA domains. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:65 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] In order to assess whether an OSC meets AC.L2-3.1.5: Least Privilege, what should be examined by the Assessor?

A. Authentication policy

B. System configurations for all systems

C.

C. User access lists that identify privileged users

D. List of terminated employees over the last three months

Answer: C

Explanation
The requirement of least privilege mandates that users be granted only the access necessary to perform their duties. Assessors confirm compliance by reviewing user access lists, ensuring privileged access is limited, documented, and assigned only where required.

Exact Extracts:

AC.L2-3.1.5: “Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.”

Assessment Guide: “Evidence includes user access lists, role-based access assignments, and documentation of privileged accounts.”

NIST SP 800-171A Objective: “Examine system access lists, rights, and permissions for least privilege.”

Why other options are not correct:

A (Authentication policy): Pertains to verifying identity, not enforcing least privilege.

B (System configurations): Provide technical settings, but access lists are the primary evidence for least privilege.

D (Terminated employees list): Tied to AC.L2-3.1.2 (Access enforcement) and AC.L2-3.1.7 (Account management), not least privilege.

Question #:66 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] The assessor begins the assessment by meeting with the client’s stakeholders and learns that multiple subsidiaries exist. In order to perform a complete assessment, the assessor must review documents from multiple entities as multiple, corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes were provided. Which of the following entities may receive certification as a result of this?

A. HQ organization

B. HQ organization and Host unit

C. Host unit and Supporting Organizations/Units

D. HQ organization, Host unit, and Supporting Organizations/Units

Answer: D

Explanation
Certification can only be granted to the legal entities that own the CAGE codes under assessment. If multiple CAGE codes are in play (HQ, host, and supporting units), and they are all included in scope, then all entities with corresponding CAGE codes that were assessed can be certified.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “The CMMC certificate is issued to the legal entity (as identified by the

CAGE code(s)) that was assessed.”

“When multiple CAGE codes are presented, all in-scope entities must provide documentation and may

be certified if assessed.”

“Certification applies to the OSC legal entity (or entities) within scope, including HQ, host, and

supporting units, as applicable.” Why other options are not correct:

A/B/C: Limit scope to only HQ or subsets, but the requirement is that all entities with provided and

in-scope CAGE codes are eligible.

Question #:67 - [CMMC Assessment Process] A Lead Assessor is preparing to conduct a Level 2 Assessment for an OSC. During the planning phase, the Lead Assessor and OSC have:

Developed evidence collection approach;

Identified the team members, resources, schedules, and logistics;

Identified and managed conflicts of interest;

Gained access to the OSC’s relevant documentation.

Based on the information provided, which would be an additional element to be discussed during the planning phase of the assessment?

A.

A. Identify and document evidence gaps

B. Describe the assessment appeals

C. Estimate a rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost for the assessment

D. Determine FedRAMP MODERATE equivalency for Cloud computing provider

Answer: A

Explanation
During the planning phase, the Lead Assessor must ensure that evidence gaps are identified and documented before assessment execution. This ensures that the OSC is aware of missing or insufficient evidence and can address them prior to final scoring.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “During planning, assessors and OSC should confirm sufficiency of

evidence and identify/document any evidence gaps.”

“The planning phase ensures readiness to proceed with the assessment, including identifying gaps and

establishing how they will be addressed.” Why the other options are not correct:

B: Appeals are addressed post-assessment, not in planning.

C: Assessment costs are agreed upon contractually, not part of the assessment planning phase.

D: FedRAMP equivalency determination is part of scope validation, not general planning. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: Assessment planning activities (pp. 5–8).

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:68 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] The OSC has changed its manner of operations in the past year to isolate its manufacturing division (which handles CUI) from its managerial team (which does not). Upon review of the provided information, the Lead Assessor was unable to identify this isolation in the environment. Which step should the Assessor take NEXT to understand how the current documentation isolates the operational components?

A. Review the network or topology diagrams

B. Review the change tickets and inventory updates

C. Review the SSP

D. Review to confirm the baseline configurations exist

Answer: A

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CAP & Scoping): Assessors must use objective artifacts to validate system boundaries and scoping decisions. Network or topology diagrams are the most direct method to confirm logical and physical separation between environments handling CUI and those that do not. Why A is Correct: Network/topology diagrams provide a visual and technical representation of how isolation is achieved (e.g., VLANs, firewalls, segmentation). This is the primary evidence source for confirming separation.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

B: Change tickets/inventory show updates but not logical isolation.

C: The SSP describes but does not demonstrate separation.

D: Baseline configs show standard builds, not network isolation.

Question #:69 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] During an assessment, an assessor is trying to determine if the organization provides protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems. The assessor has decided to use the Interview method to gather evidence. It is BEST to interview:

A. System developers

B. System or network administrators

C. Personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities

D. Personnel with security alert and advisory responsibilities

Answer: B

Explanation
Malicious code protection is typically implemented and managed by system or network administrators, who configure, deploy, and monitor anti-malware solutions. Interviews with these administrators provide direct evidence of control implementation.

Exact Extracts:

SI.L2-3.14.2: “Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “Interviews should be conducted with administrators responsible for deployment and monitoring of malicious code protection.”

NIST SP 800-171A (SI.L2-3.14.2): “Interview system or network administrators to determine how malicious code protection is implemented.”

Why other options are not correct:

A (developers): Developers do not typically manage system-wide malicious code protections.

C (audit personnel): They review logs, not deploy/manage protections.

D (security advisory staff): They track alerts but don’t operate malicious code defenses. References:

Question #:70 - [CMMC Assessment Process] An assessor is assigned by the Lead Assessor to the pre-assessment template regarding evidence. There are several entries that include how the Assessment Team will identify, obtain, and inventory evidence. What else is required to determine readiness to conduct the assessment?

A. Identify the scope of the OSC.

B. Delineate what is required to verify the evidence.

C. Delineate observations by the Assessment Team.

D. Identify additional people to interview to gather more evidence.

Answer: A

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CAP – Pre-Assessment Activities): Before the assessment, the team must confirm the assessment scope (systems, assets, CUI boundaries, and relevant environments). Without scoping, evidence identification and collection cannot be validated.

Why A is Correct: Identifying scope is the foundational requirement in the pre-assessment stage, as defined in the CMMC Assessment Process. Scope determines what systems, people, and assets are included in evidence collection.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

B: Verification of evidence occurs during assessment, not pre-assessment readiness. C: Observations are recorded during on-site assessment, not beforehand.

D: Interview selection happens during evidence collection, after scope confirmation. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:71 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] FIPS-validated cryptography is required to meet CMMC practices that protect CUI when transmitted or stored outside the OSC’s CMMC enclave. What source does the CCA use to verify that the cryptography the OSC has implemented is FIPS-validated?

A. Cryptographic section of the OSC’s SSP

B. Vendor cryptographic module documentation

C. NIST Module Validation Program

D. Cryptographic section of the Shared Responsibility Matrix

Answer: C

Explanation
The CMMC practices for cryptographic protection (SC.L2-3.13.11, SC.L2-3.13.8, etc.) require that cryptography protecting CUI must be FIPS-validated. The authoritative source for validation is the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

Extract:

“To use cryptography in compliance with CMMC requirements, organizations must use modules validated under the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). The CMVP is the authoritative source to verify whether a cryptographic implementation is FIPS-validated.”

Vendor documentation or SSP claims alone cannot serve as authoritative proof. The CCA must consult the NIST CMVP validation list.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2; SC.L2-3.13.11, SC.L2-3.13.8; CMVP Guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:72 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] While conducting an assessment, an assessor is determining if privileged accounts are used for non-privileged functions. While interviewing a user with a privileged account, the assessor should ask if the person interviewed:

A. Knows which other users have privileged accounts

B. Is knowledgeable of role-based access control privileges

C. Uses their privileged account to research vulnerabilities on the Internet

D. Can show how IT staff provision privileged and non-privileged accounts

Answer: C

Explanation
To verify compliance with AC.L2-3.1.5 (Least Privilege), the assessor must confirm that privileged accounts are not used for routine or non-privileged tasks. Asking if a user uses their privileged account for tasks like researching vulnerabilities on the Internet directly tests whether the principle of least privilege is being followed.

Exact Extracts:

AC.L2-3.1.5: “Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “Interviews should confirm that privileged accounts are used exclusively for privileged functions, and that standard accounts are used for general tasks.”

NIST SP 800-171A Objective: “Determine through interviews whether users employ privileged accounts for non-privileged tasks.”

Why other options are not correct:

A: Awareness of other privileged users is not the issue being assessed.

B: Knowledge of RBAC is useful but does not confirm account usage practices.

D: Provisioning procedures are an IT staff responsibility, not a user behavior check.

Question #:73 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] While conducting a CMMC Level 2 self-assessment, an organization’s Chief Information Security Officer asks the system administrator for evidence that remote access is routed through fully managed access control points. Which documentation would BEST demonstrate that all remote access is routed through managed access control points?

A. Network diagram and VPN logs

B. Access control policy and procedures

C. SSP and vendor management

D. Cloud service audit logs and hardware asset inventory

Answer: A

Explanation
To validate that remote access is routed through managed access control points, the assessor requires technical evidence, not just policy. The network diagram shows the design and routing of remote access through controlled points (e.g., VPN gateways), and VPN logs provide operational evidence that remote sessions are enforced through those points.

Exact Extracts:

AC.L2-3.1.14: “Route remote access through managed access control points.”

Assessment Objective (AC.L2-3.1.14[a]): “Remote access is routed through managed access control points.”

Assessment Method (Examine/Interview/Test): Requires network diagrams and remote access logs as evidence.

CMMC Assessment Guide specifies: “Network diagrams and supporting logs are required to demonstrate implementation of remote access routing.”

Why the other options are not correct:

B (policy/procedures): Policies describe intent, not proof of implementation.

C (SSP/vendor mgmt): SSPs provide system description but not direct evidence of enforcement.

D (cloud logs/hardware inventory): These do not specifically demonstrate remote access routing through managed points.

Question #:74 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] An OSC seeking Level 2 certification has a fully cloud-based environment. The assessor must evaluate fulfillment of Level 2 requirements the OSC implements versus those handled by the cloud service provider. Which document would be BEST to identify the Level 2 requirements handled by the OSC’s cloud provider?

A. Zero Trust Architecture

B. Shared Responsibility Matrix

C. Cloud Security Baseline White Paper

D. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Plan

Answer: B

Explanation
The Shared Responsibility Matrix (Customer Responsibility Matrix) is the authoritative document that specifies which security responsibilities are owned by the OSC versus the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). This enables assessors to determine which CMMC practices apply to the OSC and which are inherited from the provider.

Exact extracts:

“External Service Providers (ESPs), including CSPs, must provide a Shared Responsibility Matrix that

delineates customer versus provider responsibilities.”

“Assessors should request and review this matrix to determine practice applicability.” Why other options are incorrect:

A: Zero Trust Architecture is a design framework, not a responsibility breakdown.

C: White papers are marketing/technical resources, not binding assignments of responsibility.

D: IAM Plans address access management, not overall shared responsibilities. References:

CMMC Scoping Guide – External Service Providers.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Use of Shared Responsibility Matrices.

===========

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:75 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] In an effort to understand whether the OSC appropriately defined the scope to exclude items that should not be assessed, which description does NOT belong in the scope?

A. Data center in another state used by the OSC

B. A smoke detector that is connected to the OSC network

C. The SIEM tool used by the managed service provider in managing the OSC

D. The office where its managed service provider’s management office is located

Answer: B

Explanation
CMMC scoping focuses on assets that process, store, transmit, or protect CUI. A smoke detector connected to the OSC network is an IoT device with no impact on CUI, so it is considered Out-of-Scope. The other items (data centers used by the OSC, MSP SIEM tools, and MSP offices handling OSC management) all directly affect the OSC’s CUI environment and therefore fall within scope.

Exact extracts:

“CUI Assets are those that process, store, or transmit CUI.”

“Security Protection Assets are those that provide security functions for CUI Assets.”

“External Service Providers (e.g., MSPs, data centers, SIEMs) that support CUI Assets are in-scope.” “Assets that cannot affect the confidentiality of CUI (e.g., unrelated IoT devices) are considered Out-ofScope.”

Expanded explanation:

Data centers (A): If OSC CUI is stored or processed there, they are in-scope.

SIEM tools (C): Provide security monitoring of OSC networks — a clear Security Protection Asset. MSP office (D): MSPs providing services that affect CUI are in-scope, including their management locations.

Smoke detector (B): Despite being network-connected, it does not interact with CUI or provide protective functions; it is explicitly out-of-scope.

Why the other options are in scope:

They either process, protect, or manage CUI directly.

Excluding them would improperly narrow the assessment boundary.

CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 2, definitions of CUI Assets, Security Protection Assets, and Out-of-Scope Assets.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:76 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] During an assessment, the IT security engineers responsible for password policy for the OSC provided documentation that all passwords are protected using a one-way hashing methodology. As a result, which statement is true?

A. Passwords are protected in storage and in transit.

B. Passwords are transmitted across the network as clear cipher-text.

C. The password protection allows access but not authorization to assets.

D. The transformation makes it impossible to re-convert the hashed password.

Answer: D

Explanation
A one-way hash function is a cryptographic method used to store passwords securely. It is not reversible; hashed values cannot be converted back into the original password.

Extract from SC.L2-3.13.10:

“Store and transmit authentication information in a protected form by using one-way cryptographic transformations (e.g., hashing). One-way transformations cannot be reversed to reveal the original authentication secret.”

Thus, the correct statement is that the transformation makes it impossible to re-convert the hashed password. Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, SC.L2-3.13.10.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:77 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] The client has a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system as OT to be evaluated as part of its assessment. In reviewing network architecture and conducting interviews, the assessor determines that a firewall separates the SCADA system from the client’s enterprise network and that CUI is not processed by the SCADA system. Based on this information, what is an appropriate outcome?

A. The assessor includes the OT within the assessment

B. The assessor determines the SCADA system is out-of-scope for the assessment

C. The assessor includes all systems identified by the client as part of the assessment

D. The assessor determines that all Specialized Assets are within the scope of the assessment

Answer: B

Explanation
In CMMC scoping, only assets that process, store, or transmit CUI (CUI Assets) or that can access them (Security Protection, Contractor Risk Managed, Specialized Assets) are in-scope. Since the SCADA system is firewalled off and does not handle CUI, it does not fall under CUI Asset classification and is considered Outof-Scope.

Exact extracts:

“CUI Assets are those that process, store, or transmit CUI.”

“Assets that do not process, store, or transmit CUI and have no connectivity to CUI Assets are

considered Out-of-Scope.”

“Specialized Assets… are only in-scope if they process, store, or transmit CUI.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: Inclusion requires processing/storing/transmitting CUI.

C: OSC cannot arbitrarily bring unrelated systems into scope; CUI relevance governs scope.

D: Not all Specialized Assets are in-scope; only those with CUI interaction are.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:78 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] During a CMMC Level 2 Assessment, a CCA interviewed a system administrator on the OSC’s procedures around configuration management and endpoint security. The system administrator described how they build and deploy new systems, and noted that some users require specialized applications for their jobs. Users have been asked to email IT when they install and run an additional application so IT can add it to their list of allowed software.

What must the CCA conclude?

A. The OSC has properly implemented application deny listing.

B. The OSC has not properly implemented application allow listing.

C.

C. IT must deploy an application to report newly installed software.

D. IT does not have a policy that users notify IT when they install new applications.

Answer: B

Explanation
The CMMC practice CM.L2-3.4.8 – Application Allow Listing requires that only specifically authorized software is permitted to execute, while all other software is automatically denied.

Extract:

“Application allow listing requires that only approved, explicitly identified applications are authorized to execute on a system. Reliance on users to notify IT after the fact does not meet the requirement.”

Because the OSC’s process depends on users self-reporting rather than enforcing automated allow listing, it is not properly implemented.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, CM.L2-3.4.8 (Configuration Management).

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:79 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] A company has a server in its own Virtual Cloud used as a CUI enclave. There is a point-to-point VPN between the OSC’s office and the cloud environment. Designated users have direct access to the enclave when in the office. When working remotely, those users must establish a VPN connection between their company laptop and the cloud server.

During the assessment, the CCA asks the IT manager about external connections.

How many external connections are within the boundary for this assessment?

A. The system has one external connection through the VPN when working outside the office.

B. The system has no external connections since the OSC operates the connections and the enclave.

C. The system has one external connection through the dedicated VPN between the office and the Cloud.

D. The system has two external connections: one through the user-initiated VPNs and one to the company’ s office.

Answer: D

Explanation
External connections are defined as connections crossing the OSC’s assessment boundary. Here:

The dedicated VPN from office to cloud = one external connection.

The user-initiated VPNs from remote laptops to cloud = a second external connection.

Extract:

“External connections include all system interfaces that cross the assessment boundary, including VPNs initiated by users or established between sites.”

Thus, there are two external connections.

Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance – External Connections.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:80 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A Lead Assessor is conducting an assessment for an OSC. The OSC is currently using doors and badge access to limit access to private areas of their campus to only authorized personnel. Which item is another means of controlling physical access to areas that contain CUI?

A. Guards

B. Cameras

C. Firewalls

D. Partition walls

Answer: A

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: PE.L2-3.10.3 — “Control physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments.”

Why A is Correct: Security guards are a recognized preventive and detective physical control to limit access to only authorized individuals. Guards can verify credentials, monitor behavior, and provide real-time deterrence.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

B (Cameras): Provide monitoring and evidence, but not direct access control.

C (Firewalls): A network control, not a physical access measure.

D (Partition walls): Barriers may help physically separate areas but do not control who enters. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:81 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

A company has a firewall to regulate how data flows into and out of its network. Based on an interview with their IT staff, all connections to their systems are logged, and suspicious traffic generates alerts. Examination of which artifact should give the CCA the details on how these are implemented?

A. Physical access logs

B. Boundary protection procedures

C. Account management document

D. Configuration management policy

Answer: B

Explanation
The control SC.L2-3.13.5: Boundary Protection requires that organizations monitor and control communications at the external boundary and at key internal boundaries. The CMMC Assessment Guide states that assessors should examine boundary protection procedures to verify logging, monitoring, and alerting are defined and implemented. Physical access logs, account management documents, and configuration management policies do not provide details of how network boundaries are monitored and protected.

Exact extracts:

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: • external boundary and key internal boundaries are defined; • communications are monitored and controlled at boundaries; • traffic is checked for unauthorized transfer of information; and • boundary protection devices are configured and managed.”

“Potential Assessment Methods: Examine … boundary protection policy; boundary protection procedures; system security plan; configuration settings for boundary protection devices; logs of boundary protection devices.”

Why the other options are incorrect:

A (Physical access logs): Relates to facility entry, not network boundary protection.

C (Account management document): Addresses user account lifecycle, not firewall and traffic control.

D (Configuration management policy): Governs system changes, not firewall logging/alerting controls.

Question #:82 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

A C3PAO has contracted by an OSC to perform its assessment. Before the assessment, the Lead Assessor asks the OSC to provide an extensive list of evidence, some of which is optional and beyond the minimum requirements. The OSC is not able to fulfill the entire request. One missing document was a current and organized list of the OSC’s evidence and mappings.

Given that this is a Level 2 Assessment, what should the Lead Assessor tell the OSC?

A. “The OSC’s Assessment Official will be asked to collect evidence when requested by the assessment team.”

B. “The OSC must provide the Assessment Team with hardcopy evidence. Electronic evidence will only be collected when needed.”

C. “It’s okay that the document is missing. The Assessment Team will collect all evidence themselves to ensure its integrity.”

D. “The OSC should provide the Assessment Team with a current and organized list of their evidence and process mappings, but the assessment can continue.”

Answer: D

Explanation
The CAP requires that the OSC provide an organized and traceable set of evidence for review. While missing an evidence map does not stop the assessment, it is a best practice and strongly recommended to improve efficiency.

Extract:

“The OSC should provide an organized list of evidence and mappings to support efficient review by the assessment team. While not strictly required, it is recommended as part of readiness for a Level 2 assessment.”

Thus, the Lead Assessor should advise the OSC to provide the evidence mapping list, but the absence does not invalidate proceeding.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Evidence Preparation Guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:83 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods]

While reviewing CA.L2-3.12.3: Security Control Monitoring, the CCA notices that the assessment period is defined as one year. An OSC's SSP states that under CA.L2-3.12.3, security controls are monitored using the

same one-year periodicity to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls. The assessor understands that some CMMC practices can reference other practices for the entirety of their implementation. Is the OSC’s implementation under CA.L2-3.12.3: Security Control Monitoring acceptable?

A. No, even when referencing other practices more description is always needed.

B. No, monitoring must be conducted on an ongoing basis to ensure continued effectiveness.

C. Yes, a one-year period for security control monitoring is acceptable.

D. Yes, as long as CA.L2-3.12.1 has been scored as MET, they do need to be monitored.

Answer: B

Explanation
The requirement for CA.L2-3.12.3 – Security Control Monitoring mandates monitoring to be performed on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls. This is not satisfied by a yearly review alone.

CA.L2-3.12.3 Security Control Monitoring – Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.

The OSC’s statement in their SSP that monitoring occurs on a one-year periodic basis fails to meet this requirement, because the term "ongoing basis" implies continual or recurring monitoring activities that occur throughout the system’s lifecycle—not a single annual review.

Therefore, the assessor must determine that the OSC’s implementation is not acceptable.

Reference: CMMC 2.0, Level 2 Practice CA.L2-3.12.3 (CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Official CCA material).

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:84 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] The assessment team is discussing the pre-assessment scope with an OSC. The OSC would like to limit the scope of the security requirements in environments that contain FCI and/or CUI. In this case, the OSC should:

A. Request a single CMMC certification for both activities

B. Choose to conduct two separate CMMC certification activities

C. Define an Assessment Scope for those assets that process, store, or transmit FCI

D. Define a CMMC Self-Assessment Scope for only those assets that process, store, or transmit CUI

Answer: B

Explanation
If an OSC wishes to separate environments that process FCI from those that process CUI, they may pursue two separate CMMC certifications (Level 1 for FCI and Level 2 for CUI). A single certification cannot cover both environments unless all requirements for the higher level are met across the entire enterprise. Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “An OSC may choose to undergo multiple CMMC certification activities if they wish to limit scope between FCI and CUI environments.”

“Level 1 applies to safeguarding FCI, while Level 2 applies to CUI; separate certifications may be pursued if the OSC chooses to segregate these environments.”

Why the other options are not correct:

A: A single certification would require all assets to meet Level 2 controls, which may not be the OSC’s intent.

C: Defining scope for FCI only aligns with Level 1, but this does not meet Level 2 certification requirements for CUI.

D: A self-assessment scope only applies to Level 1 assessments, not Level 2 third-party certification. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: Scope determination for FCI vs CUI (pp. 3–5).

DoD CMMC Program documentation: Multiple certification options.

Question #:85 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC has a minimal physical footprint consisting only of network equipment, workstations, and a centralized domain environment. File storage is centralized in a third-party vendor’s FedRAMP Moderate authorized cloud environment, and employees access files using the cloud integration with their workstations. Since CUI is stored in the FedRAMP Moderate authorized environment, the OSC should prepare to have which environment(s) assessed?

A. Cloud environment only

B. OSC’s physical network only

C. Cloud environment and the OSC’s physical network

D. OSC’s physical network, the cloud environment, and the cloud vendor’s employee network

Answer: C

Explanation
Both the CSP’s cloud environment and the OSC’s on-premises network/workstations are in-scope because CUI is stored in the cloud but also accessed and transmitted by OSC assets. The cloud vendor’s internal employee network is not in-scope because only the customer-facing FedRAMP environment is within the assessment boundary.

Exact extracts:

“CUI Assets include any OSC asset that stores, processes, or transmits CUI.”

“External service providers are in-scope if their services process, store, or transmit CUI on behalf of the

OSC.”

“The OSC’s endpoints and local infrastructure that access CUI are also in-scope.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: Cloud environment only is incomplete; OSC workstations also access and transmit CUI.

B: OSC network only ignores the fact that CUI is stored in the cloud.

D: The cloud vendor’s internal employee network is not in-scope.

Question #:86 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] An OSC is presenting the CMMC Assessment to the C3PAO along with all supporting documentation. The supporting documents include drawings from a patent application that has not been filed with the patent office and are marked as attorney-client privileged. What document is recommended that the OSC and C3PAO sign?

A. Formal contract

B. Statement of Work

C. Non-disclosure agreement

D. Formal disclosure agreement

Answer: C

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) requires that when sensitive or proprietary materials are exchanged during an assessment, the OSC and the C3PAO should establish confidentiality protections through a NonDisclosure Agreement (NDA).

Extract:

“OSC and C3PAOs are expected to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to protect sensitive information such as proprietary, attorney-client privileged, or pre-patent materials shared during the assessment process.”

Thus, the NDA is the correct document.

Question #:87 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC creates standard user accounts with limited capabilities and administrator accounts with full system access. A standard user initiates the uninstall of the anti-virus software, which is organizationally defined as a privileged function. Which of the following would indicate AC.L2-3.1.7: Privileged Functions is properly implemented?

A. The antivirus software is not uninstalled.

B. The antivirus software is successfully uninstalled.

C. The antivirus software is not uninstalled, and the attempt is captured in an application audit log.

D. The antivirus software is successfully uninstalled, and the event is captured in an application audit log.

Answer: C

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: AC.L2-3.1.7 — “Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of such functions in audit logs.”

Correct Interpretation:

A non-privileged (standard) user should be prevented from performing privileged functions (e. g., uninstalling security software).

The attempt must be logged to provide traceability and support accountability.

Why C is Correct: It demonstrates both prevention (software not uninstalled) and auditing (attempt

captured in a log), exactly matching the practice. Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Prevention is shown, but there is no evidence of logging. B: Function was not prevented, so requirement not met.

D: Logging exists, but privileged action was not prevented. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:88 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] While conducting a CMMC Level 2 gap analysis with a large defense contractor, a CMMC RP confirms that the organization uses a RADIUS server for authentication. What additional method could be used to comply with AC.L2-3.1.17: Wireless Access Protection?

A. Layer 3 switch

B. Intrusion detection solution

C. WPA2-Enterprise encryption

D. Frequency-hopping wireless access

Answer: C

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: AC.L2-3.1.17 — “Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections.”

Correct Interpretation: Strong authentication and encryption methods (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise, WPA3Enterprise) are required to protect wireless communications and enforce authorization.

Why C is Correct: WPA2-Enterprise uses 802.1X authentication (often with RADIUS), ensuring that only authorized users/devices can connect. This directly supports AC.L2-3.1.17.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A (Layer 3 switch): Network hardware but not specifically a wireless access control mechanism.

B (IDS): Detects intrusions but does not prevent or authorize wireless access.

D (Frequency-hopping): Obsolete method, not aligned with modern encryption/authentication requirements.

Question #:89 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A company seeking Level 2 certification has several telecommunications closets throughout its office building. The closets contain network systems and devices that are used to transmit CUI. Which method would be BEST to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the network systems and devices housed within the closets?

A. Label the door with “Authorized Personnel Only” and maintain an authorized personnel list.

B. Install locks with badge readers on the closet doors and maintain an authorized list.

C. Install security cameras to monitor closet entrances and maintain an authorized personnel list.

D. Install keypad door locks on the closet doors and only provide the code to IT department personnel.

Answer: B

Explanation
CMMC requires physical access to systems containing or transmitting CUI to be limited to authorized individuals and for access records to be maintained. Badge readers with unique identification provide individual accountability, access control enforcement, and auditable access logs, which are stronger than labels, cameras, or keypads.

Exact Extracts:

PE.L2-3.10.1: “Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective

operating environments to authorized individuals.”

PE.L2-3.10.5: “Maintain audit logs of physical access.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “Badge systems with access control lists and logs are considered a best

method for meeting physical access requirements.” Why the other options are not correct:

A: Labels and lists do not prevent unauthorized access.

C: Cameras monitor but do not restrict access; they are detective, not preventive.

D: Keypads do not provide individual accountability (codes can be shared).

Question #:90 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC uses an External Service Provider (ESP) to support part of its CUI processing scope. The OSC has selected an accredited ESP with FedRAMP MODERATE authorization. The OSC has a contract requiring the ESP to meet its security requirements. The ESP has provided a Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM) consistent with the contract terms.

When assessing these assets, what should the assessor MOST carefully review?

A. The contract terms to ensure that the OSC’s CMMC Level 2 requirements are in the contract, and the SRM to ensure that the shared responsibilities are well defined.

B. The contract terms to ensure that the OSC’s CMMC Level 2 requirements are in the contract, and the SRM to ensure that the ESP’s responsibilities are well defined.

C. The ESP’s FedRAMP MODERATE authorization to ensure the OSC’s CMMC Level 2 requirements are MET, and the SRM to ensure that the ESP’s responsibilities are well defined.

D. The ESP’s FedRAMP MODERATE authorization to ensure the OSC’s CMMC Level 2 requirements are MET, and the SRM to ensure that the shared responsibilities are well defined.

Answer: A

Explanation
The CAP and Scoping Guidance specify that the assessor must review both:

The contract — to confirm that the OSC’s CMMC requirements are flowed down to the ESP, and The Shared Responsibility Matrix — to confirm responsibilities are clearly assigned between OSC and ESP.

Extract:

“Assessors must review contracts and shared responsibility matrices to ensure that OSC responsibilities and provider responsibilities are clearly defined, and that requirements are flowed down appropriately.”

Thus, option A is the most complete.

Question #:91 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A company mirrors its FCI/CUI data storage in a cloud environment. Data is managed across multiple virtual machines (VMs). To satisfy requirements for data security of the LOCAL copy using physical controls, what should the OSC do?

A. Use encrypted transport and storage of FCI/CUI data on the VMs.

B. Store FCI/CUI data without encryption for faster access/backup/restore.

C. Ensure that the VMs are running on hardware that is physically located in a controlled-access facility.

D. In addition to a password or personal identification number, use physical means to log in such as a smart card or hard token.

Answer: C

Explanation
The Physical Protection (PE) requirements require that systems containing FCI or CUI be placed in controlled-access facilities with safeguards against unauthorized physical access.

Extract from PE.L2-3.10.1:

“Limit physical access to organizational information systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.”

Thus, ensuring that the VMs run on hardware located in a controlled-access facility is the correct method to meet physical security requirements.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, PE.L2-3.10.1.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:92 - [CMMC Assessment Process] While completing the Level 2 Assessment, the Lead Assessor found that the OSC was deficient on a number of CMMC practices. Forty practices were scored as NOT MET, all on the Authorized Deficiency Corrections list. The OSC remediated 17 of those during closeout, leaving 23 practices still NOT MET. What should the Lead Assessor recommend?

A. Pass the OSC but put the 23 remaining on a POA&M

B. Fail the OSC and require them to remediate and reapply for Level 2 certification

C. Recommend an interim certification and put the 23 remaining practices on a POA&M

D. Recommend an interim certification and revisit the failed practices upon certification renewal

Answer: B

Explanation
Under CMMC 2.0 Level 2, POA&Ms are permitted only for a limited subset of practices and only if the organization achieves at least 80% compliance, with no high-weight practices failed. With 23 practices NOT MET, the OSC falls below this threshold. Therefore, the Lead Assessor must recommend a Fail, requiring remediation and reassessment.

Exact extracts:

“For Level 2, OSCs must achieve a score of at least 80% and cannot fail any high-weighted practices.”

“POA&Ms may be allowed for a small number of selected practices but must be closed within 180

days.”

“If the OSC does not meet minimum requirements, the assessment result is Fail and the OSC must

remediate before reapplying.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: POA&Ms cannot cover such a large number of deficiencies.

C/D: Interim certification does not exist in CMMC 2.0.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, POA&M policy.

DoD CMMC 2.0 Program guidance on minimum passing scores and fail conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:93 - [CMMC Assessment Process] A company is seeking Level 2 CMMC certification. During the Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Evaluation, the Lead Assessor is deciding whether the company can be moved to a POA&M Close-Out. What condition will result if a POA&M Close-Out option cannot be utilized?

A. The assessment will be paused until the OSC can meet all practices.

B. The Lead Assessor will ask the OSC to justify not meeting all the practices.

C. The OSC will be granted a provisional status until it can meet all the practices.

D. The Lead Assessor will not recommend the OSC for CMMC Level 2 certification.

Answer: D

Explanation
If the OSC cannot remediate deficiencies during the POA&M Close-Out process, the Lead Assessor must issue a recommendation of NOT MET, and the OSC will not be certified. CMMC requires all Level 2 practices to be MET (with limited exceptions under defined POA&M close-out rules).

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “If practices cannot be met within the POA&M Close-Out process, the

Lead Assessor must not recommend certification.”

DoD policy: “CMMC Level 2 requires that all 110 practices be met. A failed POA&M Close-Out

results in a final determination of NOT MET.”

“There is no provisional certification status in CMMC.” Why the other options are not correct:

A: Assessments are not paused indefinitely; unresolved deficiencies result in NOT MET.

B: Justification alone does not satisfy requirements.

C: Provisional status does not exist in CMMC.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: POA&M Close-Out procedures (pp. 14–16). DoD CMMC Program Documentation: Requirement for all practices to be MET for certification.

Question #:94 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] Some OSCs share real estate with other companies. To protect FCI/CUI behind unmanned entrances to buildings, floors, or other areas where FCI/CUI is created, used, stored, or transmitted, which of the following is the BEST method?

A. Turnstiles to limit access

B. Cameras to monitor and record foot traffic

C. Bold signage with strong language to discourage entry

D. One-way gates which require proper credentials or intercom authorization to unlock and permit entry

Answer: D

Explanation
The Physical Protection (PE) practices require that unmanned access points to areas containing CUI be restricted with technical controls that only allow entry to authorized personnel. While cameras, signage, and turnstiles support security, they do not actually prevent access.

Extract from PE.L2-3.10.1:

“Limit physical access to organizational information systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.”

The strongest measure listed is one-way gates requiring credentials or intercom authorization, which directly enforces access control.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, PE.L2-3.10.1.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:95 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] An Assessor is evaluating whether an OSC has implemented adequate controls to meet AC.L2-3.1.7: Privileged Functions. The OSC has procedures that define privileged vs. non-privileged account provisioning and an access control policy that restricts execution of certain functions only to privileged users. What might the Assessor do to further evaluate the implementation of this practice?

A. Examine system logs to verify automatic updates are being applied.

B. Test whether the application of a patch is captured in system logging.

C. Test whether a non-privileged user can log into a system where CUI is stored.

D. Examine a user access list for users that are authorized to access a key management system.

Answer: D

Explanation
AC.L2-3.1.7 (Privileged Functions) requires that execution of privileged functions be restricted to authorized privileged accounts. The best evidence is an access list demonstrating who is allowed privileged access.

Extract:

“Limit the use of privileged functions to authorized users. Assessors should review access control lists or equivalent evidence to verify only privileged accounts have privileged permissions.”

Thus, the best next step is to examine a user access list for authorized privileged users. Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, AC.L2-3.1.7.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:96 - [CMMC Assessment Process] The Lead Assessor concludes that the OSC is not ready for the assessment. After the Readiness Assessment Review, the OSC and the Lead Assessor could choose to:

A. Replan or cancel the assessment.

B. Replan or reschedule the assessment.

C. Proceed as planned or cancel the assessment.

D. Proceed as planned or reschedule the assessment.

Answer: B

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) provides explicit guidance for readiness reviews. If the Lead Assessor determines that the OSC is not prepared, the available options are:

Replan the assessment (adjust scope, timeline, or requirements), or

Reschedule the assessment (move the engagement to a later date).

Extract:

“Following the readiness review, if the OSC is determined not to be ready, the Lead Assessor may recommend that the assessment be replanned or rescheduled.”

Thus, the correct answer is B.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Readiness Review section.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:97 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC has an established password policy. The OSC wants to improve its password protection security by implementing a single change. Which of the following is an acceptable element to add to the OSC’s password policy?

A. Require passwords to be changed every 18 months.

B. Require passwords to be 5 to 7 characters long.

C. Add the use of salted two-way cryptographic hashes of passwords.

D. Add the use of salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords, where possible.

Answer: D

Explanation
The Identification and Authentication (IA) practices require that passwords be protected using strong methods. Storing passwords with salted one-way hashes ensures they cannot be reversed, providing strong protection.

Extract from IA.L2-3.5.10:

“Passwords must be stored and transmitted in a form that is resistant to compromise, typically using salted one-way cryptographic hashes.”

Options A and B do not align with modern password guidance, and option C (two-way cryptographic hashing) is insecure because it allows reversal.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, IA.L2-3.5.10.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:98 - [Scoping and System Boundaries]

An OSC has a testing laboratory. The lab has several pieces of equipment, including a workstation that is used to analyze test information collected from the test equipment. All equipment is on the same VLAN that is part of the certification assessment. The OSC claims that the workstation is part of the test equipment (Specialized Asset) and only needs to be addressed under risk-based security policies. However, the OSC states that the data analysis output is CUI. What is the assessor’s BEST response?

A. Disagree with the OSC and include the workstation in the full assessment.

B. Disagree with the OSC and score practice CA.L2-3.12.4: System Security Plan as NOT MET.

C. Agree with the OSC but perform a limited check of the system, not increasing the assessment cost or duration.

D. Agree with the OSC and determine if it is managed using the contractor’s risk-based information security procedures and practices.

Answer: A

Explanation
If an asset processes or generates CUI, it is a CUI Asset by definition, regardless of whether it is also part of a test lab or claimed as a Specialized Asset. Specialized Asset handling applies only when the asset does not process, store, or transmit CUI. Since the workstation outputs CUI, it must be assessed fully against CMMC practices.

Exact extracts:

“CUI Assets are those that process, store, or transmit CUI.”

“Specialized Assets… do not process, store, or transmit CUI.”

“If a Specialized Asset processes CUI, it must be categorized as a CUI Asset and is assessed against all applicable practices.”

Why the other options are incorrect:

B: The issue is not with the SSP practice; it is with misclassification of an asset.

C/D: Risk-based treatment applies only to Specialized Assets without CUI, which is not the case here. References:

CMMC Level 2 Scoping Guide – Specialized Assets; CUI Asset definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:99 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC assigns new hires to work on their hire date. Human Resources ensures that all screening activities are completed before the end of the employees’ first week. How should the CCA score PS.L2-3.9.1: Screen Individuals?

A. As NOT MET but it can be remediated post-assessment

B. As NOT MET and this will cause the assessment to fail

C. As MET since the OSC ensured Human Resources was handling the screening

D. As NOT MET because all screening must be completed prior to the start of employment

Answer: D

Explanation
The control PS.L2-3.9.1: Screen Individuals requires that individuals be screened before authorizing access to organizational systems and CUI. Since employees are assigned to work immediately upon hire, before screenings are complete, this practice is NOT MET. Completing screenings within the first week does not satisfy the requirement.

Exact extracts:

“Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI.”

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: [a] individuals requiring access to CUI are screened before

access is granted.”

“It is not sufficient for screening to occur after access has been authorized.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: Remediation may be possible, but scoring must be NOT MET.

B: A single practice being NOT MET does not automatically cause assessment failure (depends on aggregate score).

C: HR responsibility does not excuse failure to complete screening before granting access. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, PS.L2-3.9.1 “Screen Individuals.”

Question #:100 - [CMMC Assessment Process] A company has five individual buildings in one business complex. During the assessment, the Assessment Team sees people entering and exiting the buildings and notices that none of the buildings have keypads or locks. The Assessment Team needs to determine how physical access is managed and controlled.

Which artifact BEST describes how access to these buildings is managed?

A. System Security Plan (SSP)

B. Personnel Access List

C. Identification and Authorization Plan

D. Physical and Environmental Protection Policy

Answer: D

Explanation
The Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) Policy is the governing artifact that describes how physical access to facilities and environments is managed and controlled. While the SSP provides a systemwide overview, and access lists provide details of who is authorized, it is the PE Policy that explicitly documents the physical access control measures required under CMMC.

Extract from PE.L2-3.10.1:

“Organizations must develop, document, and disseminate physical and environmental protection policies that govern how access to buildings and systems containing CUI is limited to authorized individuals.” Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, PE.L2-3.10.1.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:101 - [Scoping and System Boundaries]

The Assessment Team is meeting with the OSC team and experiences a situation where some members of the OSC team describe the IT infrastructure differently from others. In some discussions, one person identifies a series of ESPs, while another describes the infrastructure as on-premises. What should the Lead Assessor do to clarify the actual operational environment?

A. Review the network diagrams

B. Interview an authoritative OSC representative

C. Review the system interconnection agreements

D. Ask for the contact information of the identified ESPs

Answer: A

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CAP – Scoping and Evidence Validation): When inconsistencies arise about the environment, assessors are required to examine objective artifacts that define boundaries, such as network diagrams and system architecture documentation.

Why A is Correct: Network diagrams objectively show whether systems are hosted on-premises or involve ESPs (cloud, MSSPs, hosting providers). Reviewing them avoids ambiguity from inconsistent verbal descriptions.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

B: Interviewing another OSC representative may add to confusion rather than resolve it.

C: Interconnection agreements confirm ESP relationships but do not resolve whether the OSC has on-prem or hybrid environments.

D: Contacting ESPs directly is not part of the assessment process; OSC must provide evidence. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:102 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An assessor is examining an organization’s system maintenance program. While reviewing the system maintenance policy and the OSC’s maintenance records for the CUI network, the assessor notices there is no mention of printers. The assessor asks the IT manager if the company has any printers.

Why is the assessor concerned if the OSC has printers?

A. Printers must be completely isolated from all non-CUI assets.

B. Firmware on a network printer needs to have updates as needed.

C. Printers cannot be used on a CUI network without government approval.

D. Printers can produce hard copies of CUI data that need to be safeguarded.

Answer: D

Explanation
Printers are a concern because they can produce hard copies of CUI, which must be safeguarded like digital CUI. CUI handling requirements extend to both electronic and printed media.

Extract from MP.L2-3.8.4:

“Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest and in use, including hardcopy outputs such as printed material.” Thus, the concern is that printed CUI must be protected, making printers relevant to maintenance and safeguarding practices.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, MP Domain.

Question #:103 - [CMMC Assessment Process] The Lead Assessor and OSC Assessment Official determined the resources, cost, and schedule for an upcoming assessment. The Lead Assessor noted the OSC Assessment Official’s preferences regarding the limits of the method and the consequent resource, cost, and schedule constraints to arrive at an optimal Assessment Plan. In this situation, who has responsibility for signing the planning agreement?

A. Lead Assessor

B. OSC Assessment Official

C. OSC Assessment Official and Lead Assessor

D. OSC Assessment Official, Lead Assessor, and C3PAO

Answer: C

Explanation
The Assessment Plan (planning agreement) must be signed by both the Lead Assessor and the OSC Assessment Official. This formalizes agreement on scope, resources, and methodology. The C3PAO is responsible for overall oversight but does not co-sign the plan.

Exact extracts:

“The Lead Assessor is responsible for developing the Assessment Plan in collaboration with the OSC Assessment Official.”

“Both the Lead Assessor and the OSC Assessment Official must sign the Assessment Plan to proceed.” “The C3PAO maintains responsibility for quality assurance and submission, but not signing.”

Why other options are incorrect:

A/B: Both signatures are required, not one alone.

D: The C3PAO does not sign the planning agreement.

Question #:104 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] During preparations for a CMMC Level 2 Assessment, a client submits a request to their consulting RP to learn more about Specialized Asset requirements. The client is unsure if their camera system, used for safety data collection purposes within their machining shop, should be documented within the SSP. Which reason is a satisfactory reason to exclude the camera system from the SSP, and thus the assessment scope?

A. The video data are deleted every seven days.

B. The Technology Control Plan does not address the camera system.

C. The camera data are uploaded to a FedRAMP MODERATE authorized cloud storage system.

D. The camera system network is physically and logically isolated and does not capture data related to controlled projects.

Answer: D

Explanation
The Scoping Guidance for Specialized Assets allows exclusion of assets when they are physically and logically isolated from the CMMC assessment boundary and do not process, store, or transmit CUI. Extract from CMMC Scoping Guidance:

“Specialized Assets may be designated as out-of-scope if they are physically or logically separated from CUI assets, or if they are inherently unable to process, store, or transmit CUI.”

The camera system in this case does not interact with CUI and is fully isolated, making exclusion appropriate.

Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance, Specialized Assets Section.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:105 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] Both FCI and CUI are stored by an OSC on the same network. Server A contains file shares with FCI, and Server B contains file shares with CUI. The OSC hopes each server would only undergo the assessment for the classification of data it contains. What is the MOST correct assessment situation in this scenario?

A. Due to the presence of CUI on the network, a Level 2 certification is required for the network

B. Server A may undergo a Level 1 self-assessment, while Server B must obtain a Level 2 certification

C. Due to the presence of FCI on the network, only a Level 1 self-assessment is required for the network

D. The network must be segmented to separate FCI from CUI before any assessments can be conducted

Answer: A

Explanation
When CUI and FCI reside on the same network, the entire environment is considered a CUI environment. The presence of CUI drives the assessment requirement to CMMC Level 2, regardless of whether FCI also exists. Assets cannot be assessed separately under Level 1 vs. Level 2 within the same network boundary. Exact extracts:

“If CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted within an environment, the environment is in scope for

CMMC Level 2.”

“The presence of CUI dictates the assessment level, regardless of whether FCI is also present.”

“Segmentation may reduce scope, but if assets remain within the same environment, all assets fall under

Level 2.”

Why other options are incorrect:

B: Level 1 cannot be applied to Server A while Server B undergoes Level 2 in the same network.

C: Presence of CUI means Level 2 is required, not Level 1.

D: Segmentation can reduce scope but is not required before assessment; it is an OSC design choice. References:

CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 2 (FCI vs. CUI environments).

CMMC Assessment Guide – Applicability of Level 1 vs. Level 2.

Question #:106 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

While assessing a company, the CCA is determining whether the company controls and manages connections between its corporate network and all external networks. The company has: (1) a strict employee policy prohibiting personal Internet use and personal email on company computers, and (2) firewalls plus a connection allow-list so only authorized external networks can connect to the company network. Are these safeguards sufficient to meet the applicable CMMC requirement?

A. Yes. The company’s strict employee policy is the best practice for meeting the requirement.

B. No. The company must isolate its system from all external connections to meet the requirement.

C. Yes. The company’s firewalls and connection allow-lists are appropriate technical controls to meet the requirement.

D. No. The company needs full control over all external systems it interfaces with to meet the requirement.

Answer: C

Explanation
Applicable CMMC/NIST Requirement: AC.L2-3.1.20 — “Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external systems.”

Isolation Not Required (refutes B): The requirement acknowledges that individuals using external systems (e.g., contractors, partners) may need to access organizational systems. In such cases, organizations must ensure those connections do not compromise or harm organizational systems. Therefore, complete isolation from all external systems is not mandated.

Policy Alone is Insufficient (refutes A): Assessment guidance requires mechanisms that technically enforce terms and conditions for use of external systems. A written employee policy by itself does not satisfy the requirement unless paired with technical enforcement (e.g., firewalls, connection rules).

Allow-lists & Firewalls are Best Practice (supports C): Assessment considerations specify that organizations should restrict external systems to an approved list, such as by using firewalls, VPNs, IP restrictions, or certificates. The company’s use of firewalls and a connection allow-list directly addresses this requirement.

Full Control of External Systems Not Required (refutes D): The definition of “external systems” clarifies that organizations typically do not have direct supervision or authority over those systems. The requirement is to limit and control connections to such systems, not to own or fully manage them.

Assessment Objectives for AC.L2-3.1.20 (from NIST SP 800-171A):

Connections to external systems are identified.

Use of external systems is identified.

Connections to external systems are verified.

Use of external systems is verified.

Connections to external systems are controlled/limited.

Use of external systems is controlled/limited.

Firewalls and allow-lists satisfy these verification and limitation requirements, enabling a CCA to mark the practice MET if evidence is present.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:107 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] A company has a CUI enclave for handling all CUI processed, stored, and transmitted through the organization. While interviewing the IT manager, the CCA asks how assets that can, but are not intended to, handle CUI are identified. The IT manager refers to the CUI system’s network diagram (which includes these assets) as well as the asset inventory (which lists these assets as Contractor Risk Managed Assets). Which other artifact MUST also mention these assets?

A. The identification and authentication policy should show how these assets are identified.

B. The physical protection policy should list these assets as being part of the physical environment of the organization.

C. The awareness and training program should include these assets so they are covered for all employees.

D. The SSP should show these assets are managed using the company’s risk-based security policies, procedures, and practices.

Answer: D

Explanation
Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMA) are required to be identified in the System Security Plan (SSP) because the SSP must describe how each in-scope asset category is managed, including risk-based policies, procedures, and practices. Network diagrams and inventories alone are insufficient without documentation in the SSP.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Scoping Guide: “Contractor Risk Managed Assets are part of the CMMC Assessment Scope and must be identified in the OSC’s SSP and supporting documentation.”

“The SSP must describe how the contractor manages risk for Contractor Risk Managed Assets.”

“The asset categories (CUI assets, Security Protection Assets, Contractor Risk Managed Assets, Specialized Assets) must be included in the SSP with supporting evidence.”

Why the other options are not correct:

A: Identification/authentication policy does not specifically require mention of CRMAs.

B: Physical protection policies address facility controls, not risk-managed assets.

C: Awareness training covers employees, not technical classification of assets.

D: Correct, because the SSP must explicitly document how CRMAs are managed using risk-based approaches.

CMMC Assessment Scope – Level 2, Version 2.13: Asset categories and documentation requirements for CRMAs (pp. 6–10).

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: SSP documentation requirements (pp. 12–14).

Question #:108 - [CMMC Assessment Process] An assessor is reviewing whether an organization appropriately analyzed the security impact of a new release of an application. Which of the following documents is MOST useful for the assessor to review?

A. A description of the change from the software vendor

B. Change Control Board (CCB) meeting minutes and supporting documents

C. System audit logs showing that the change occurred, when, and by whom

D. A log of security incidents/issues after the change was implemented

Answer: B

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: CM.L2-3.4.3 — “Track, review, approve/disapprove, and audit changes to organizational systems.”

Why CCB Minutes Are Correct (supports B):

Change Control Board (CCB) documentation includes impact analyses, approvals, disapprovals, and justification for system changes.

The CMMC Assessment Guide explicitly identifies CCB minutes and supporting records as primary evidence of compliance with change management practices.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A (Vendor description): Provides information on the update, but does not show organizational review or approval.

C (Audit logs): Show when a change occurred, but not whether it was analyzed and approved beforehand.

D (Incident logs): Reflects results after implementation, but not the review/approval process. Assessment Guidance Extract (NIST SP 800-171A, CM.L2-3.4.3):

Objectives include verifying that system changes are:

Documented, Reviewed, Approved/disapproved, and Audited.

Evidence such as CCB minutes and approval records directly satisfies these objectives.

Question #:109 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC is a wholly owned subsidiary of a large conglomerate (parent organization). The OSC and the parent organization use ID badges (PKI cards) that contain a PKI certificate and a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag used for building and system access (including systems that process, transmit, or store CUI). The parent organization does not make any decisions on how the OSC runs its security program or other matters of significance. The large conglomerate operates a machine that is used to activate the badges for both itself and the OSC. This machine is isolated in a locked room and has no network connectivity to the OSC.

The badge activation system is:

A. In-scope because the parent organization acts as an External Service Provider to the OSC by providing PKI cards.

B. In-scope because the OSC is part of the large conglomerate and thus any CMMC requirements of the OSC are imputed onto the large conglomerate.

C. Out-of-scope because the OSC is the one that assigns the appropriate access to a particular PKI card.

D. Out-of-scope because the badge activation machine is physically and logically isolated from the OSC and it is under the control of the parent organization.

Answer: D

Explanation
According to CMMC Scoping Guidance, assets controlled by a parent organization are out-of-scope when they are physically and logically isolated from the OSC’s environment and do not process, store, or transmit CUI within the OSC’s boundary.

Extract from Scoping Guidance:

“Out-of-Scope assets are those that cannot process, store, or transmit CUI because they are physically or logically separated from CUI assets, or they are inherently unable to do so.”

Since the badge activation machine is completely isolated and managed by the parent organization, and it has no network connectivity to the OSC, it is out-of-scope.

Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance, Level 2.

Question #:110 - [Scoping and System Boundaries]

The OSC has assembled its documentation relating to how it controls remote access for assessment. The Lead Assessor compared this documentation to the provided topology map and noted several indications of external connections with External Service Providers (ESPs). Which document is MOST LIKELY to show acceptable evidence of the security controls related to the interface between the OSC and the ESP?

A. OSC’s access control policy

B. Interconnection agreement with ESPs

C. Technical design of the security of the available VPN

D. Instructions provided to the OSC from the ESP to implement remote access

Answer: B

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CMMC/NIST): Multiple practices may apply (e.g., AC.L2-3.1.14 “Control remote access sessions” and CA.L2-3.12.4 “Develop, document, and periodically update system security plans”). However, when an OSC uses an External Service Provider (ESP), the key control is the documented agreement defining the terms, conditions, and responsibilities between the OSC and the ESP.

Why Interconnection Agreement is Correct (supports B):

According to the CMMC Assessment Guide (Level 2), acceptable evidence for external connections with ESPs includes “interconnection security agreements, memoranda of understanding, or contracts that define the security requirements governing the connection.”

These agreements document controls at the interface boundary and ensure both parties understand their responsibilities for protecting CUI.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A. OSC’s access control policy — An internal policy outlines organizational expectations, but it does not constitute binding evidence of controls at the boundary with an ESP.

C. Technical design of VPN security — Technical configurations demonstrate how connections are secured, but they do not formally document agreed security requirements between OSC and ESP.

D. Instructions from ESP — ESP-provided setup instructions are not evidence of the OSC’s validated control implementation or responsibility-sharing agreement.

Assessment Process Alignment:

The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) requires assessors to confirm not only technical implementations but also documented agreements that establish accountability for safeguarding CUI.

Evidence such as interconnection agreements is specifically highlighted as objective evidence that the OSC has verified and controlled external system interfaces.

Question #:111 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

While examining controls on the use of portable storage devices, an assessor conducts an interview with a mid-level internal system administrator. The administrator describes the process to check out portable storage devices, which includes a user emailing IT staff directly, verifying that the media classification label matches the data classification, and limiting use of the device to a specified external system.

What is a MISSING element for the assessment of AC.L2-3.1.21: Portable Storage Use?

A. Method of destruction of portable storage devices

B. Recorded management authorization for the use of portable storage devices

C. An inventory of portable storage devices provided by the National Security Agency

D. A directory of personnel background checks to be consulted prior to device checkout

Answer: B

Explanation
AC.L2-3.1.21 requires that the use of portable storage devices be restricted and explicitly authorized. The described process covers labeling and limiting use but does not include documented management authorization.

Extract:

“Restrict the use of portable storage devices on external systems. Authorization for use must be formally documented and approved by management.”

Thus, the missing element is recorded management authorization. Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, AC.L2-3.1.21.

Question #:112 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] During an assessment, the team is interviewing the IT staff to understand the ways in which the organization protects backup data. Because the company’s backups contain CUI, the Lead Assessor asks the IT engineer which method is used to ensure that the confidentiality of the backup data is being protected. Which implementation is LEAST LIKELY to be acceptable?

A. Alternative physical controls for site access

B. Managing who has access to the information

C. Physically securing devices and media that contain CUI

D. Encrypting files or media using industry-standard encryption

Answer: A

Explanation
When protecting backup data containing CUI, the requirement is to ensure confidentiality through logical or physical security controls appropriate to the sensitivity of CUI. Acceptable implementations include controlling access to CUI (AC family controls), physically securing media (MP family controls), and encrypting files or media (SC family controls). Merely implementing alternative physical controls for site access is insufficient because site access protections do not directly ensure the confidentiality of the backup media itself.

Exact Extracts (from official CMMC Assessor/Study documents and NIST SP 800-171A references):

SC.L2-3.13.16 (Encrypt CUI): “Employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI during storage and transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.”

MP.L2-3.8.9 (Protect backup CUI): “Protect the confidentiality of backup CUI at storage locations.” AC.L2-3.1.3 (Access enforcement): “Limit access to CUI on the basis of need-to-know to protect confidentiality.”

Physical security references (PE family): “Physical access controls provide general site protection but are not substitutes for encryption or media protection controls when CUI confidentiality is at risk.”

Why the other options are correct (acceptable methods):

B (Managing who has access to the information): Satisfies Access Control (AC) requirements that limit exposure of CUI only to authorized individuals.

C (Physically securing devices and media): Satisfies Media Protection (MP) requirements, ensuring CUI is stored securely and protected against unauthorized access.

D (Encrypting files or media): Directly satisfies System and Communications Protection (SC) requirements for confidentiality, a highly reliable method.

Why option A is least acceptable:

Alternative physical controls for site access protect buildings or rooms, but they do not directly safeguard backup media confidentiality. If backups are removed, lost, or accessed internally, site access controls alone cannot ensure confidentiality.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: Practices SC.L2-3.13.16, MP.L2-3.8.9, AC.L23.1.3, and PE family discussion (pp. 93–96, 108–110, 125–127).

Question #:113 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods]

A midsized professional services organization that frequently contracts with government entities is undergoing a CMMC Level 2 assessment. The CCA interviews IT leadership about their audit logging capabilities and determines that a third-party vendor is responsible for correlating and reviewing audit logs. During the interview, they discuss the process that has been implemented by the vendor to provide a monthly summary of their audit log review to the organization. What issue should the CCA resolve during the interview?

A. The vendor has the ability to provide report generation.

B. The vendor may not use the same authoritative time source.

C. Audit logs must be reviewed on at least a weekly basis for CMMC requirements.

D. Audit logs should not be correlated and reviewed by a third party as they may contain CUI.

Answer: C

Explanation
CMMC Level 2 requires that audit logs be reviewed and updated at least weekly to detect anomalies and potential security incidents. A vendor providing only monthly summaries does not meet the requirement. The assessor must resolve this issue to confirm compliance.

Exact Extracts (official CMMC Assessor/Study documents):

AU.L2-3.3.7: “Review and update logged events, as well as the audit log, at least weekly.” AU.L2-3.3.6: “Review and analyze information system audit records for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity and report findings.”

CMMC Level 2 Assessment Guide emphasizes: “Organizations must demonstrate procedures to review audit logs at least weekly, even when external vendors perform this function.”

NIST SP 800-171A states: “The frequency of review must be sufficient to detect anomalies in a timely manner… at least weekly is required.”

Why other options are not correct:

A: Report generation capability is not the compliance issue; frequency of review is.

B: Using a common authoritative time source (AU.L2-3.3.7) is important, but the deficiency here is frequency of log review, not time source.

D: Third-party involvement is permitted if the OSC maintains control and ensures requirements (frequency, integrity, protection of CUI) are met.

Question #:114 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] While examining the customer responsibility matrix submitted by the OSC for one of its Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), the Assessor notes that the matrix was substantially completed by the OSC’s RPO. In fact, there is a statement from the RPO that the CSP has met the requirements for FedRAMP MODERATE.

In order to accept that this CSP is qualified to perform some of the practices on behalf of the OSC, what should occur?

A. The CSP must have its service certified for FedRAMP by a certified C3PAO.

B. The OSC should provide the contract documents for the CSP specifying that it must meet NIST SP 800171 practices.

C. The OSC must be able to demonstrate that the CSP is providing its services in a manner that complies with CMMC Level 2.

D. There must be other evidence that an independent firm has confirmed the security controls meeting FedRAMP MODERATE are in place.

Answer: C

Explanation
The OSC remains responsible for ensuring that any External Service Provider (ESP) such as a CSP supports compliance with CMMC. FedRAMP authorization is evidence, but the OSC must still demonstrate that the CSP’s services are being used in a manner that complies with CMMC Level 2 requirements.

Extract:

“The OSC is responsible for demonstrating that services provided by external providers are implemented and operated in a manner that complies with CMMC requirements for the OSC’s environment.”

Therefore, the OSC must provide proof of compliance in their environment, not simply rely on FedRAMP documentation.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2; Scoping Guidance, External Service Providers.

Question #:115 - [CMMC Assessment Process] A CCA is conducting an interview with an OSC team member about an offering from a well-known Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The offering is known to be secure, but the OSC has not provided evidence and the person being interviewed is unsure how the offering works. Will this offering be accepted by the Assessment Team?

A. Yes, because of the process of reciprocity

B. No, the OSC failed to train on the offering

C. No, because the OSC lacks adequate and sufficient evidence

D. Yes, because the CSP offering is a well-known, secure offering

Answer: C

Explanation
CMMC assessments are evidence-based. An offering cannot be accepted solely on reputation or assumptions of security. The OSC must provide adequate and sufficient evidence that the CSP offering meets CMMC requirements. Without evidence, the assessor cannot mark the practice as MET.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “Assessment determinations must be based on objective evidence; absence of evidence results in a finding of NOT MET.”

“Evidence may include documentation, interviews, and tests but must be sufficient to confirm implementation.”

“Reciprocity is not granted for external offerings unless evidence is provided.”

Why other options are not correct:

A (reciprocity): CMMC does not allow blanket reciprocity for cloud offerings without validation.

B (training issue): Training is separate; the core issue is lack of evidence.

D (well-known CSP): Reputation alone is not evidence; objective evidence is required.

Question #:116 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

While conducting a CMMC Level 2 Third-Party Assessment of a small defense contractor, an assessor discovers that the contractor’s Information Security Policy has no documented change records demonstrating executive approval. The IT director states that they will add change records in the future, but that other evidence exists. Which documentation is MOST able to demonstrate persistent and habitual adherence to CMMC requirements?

A. Handwritten notes from executive committee meetings discussing implementation

B. Several years’ worth of saved emails from the executive team approving policies and directing adherence

C. A notarized letter from the previous CEO stating that they approved information security policies annually

D. Transcribed interviews with new employees discussing their understanding of information security policies

Answer: B

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: CA.L2-3.12.4 — “Develop, document, periodically review/update, and disseminate system security plans.” Policies require executive approval and evidence of regular review.

Why B is Correct: Multiple years of emails from executives approving policies provide a pattern of consistent executive involvement, demonstrating habitual compliance with review and approval requirements. This is stronger evidence than one-time or informal attestations.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Handwritten notes are informal and lack authenticity controls.

C: A notarized letter from a previous CEO is a one-time attestation, not evidence of recurring review.

D: Employee interviews may demonstrate awareness but do not show executive approval. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:117 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] While conducting a CMMC Level 2 assessment at a 100-person manufacturing company, the assessor receives a yellow badge labeled “SPECIAL ACCESS.” The assessor observes multiple badge types used by staff and visitors. The client explains that only three badge colors correspond to controlled access (with electronic access), while the rest are identifiers for seniority. How can the assessor BEST verify that the three colors are the only badges capable of accessing controlled areas for CUI-related activities?

A. Interviewing CUI-cleared staff

B. Reviewing standard operating procedures for badge issuance

C. Reviewing retained electronic badge entry logs or audits thereof

D. Borrowing a badge from another staff member and attempting to enter a controlled space

Answer: C

Explanation
Verification of physical access controls under PE.L2-3.10.3: Physical Access Control requires evidence from records, logs, and audit trails. Reviewing access logs provides direct confirmation of which badge types grant entry into controlled areas. SOPs or interviews may support the claim but are indirect; testing physical entry is not an approved method for CCAs.

Exact extracts:

“Assessment Methods – Examine: access control policy; physical access control system records;

physical access audit logs.”

“Assessment Methods – Interview: staff may be interviewed, but interviews must be supported by

documentary evidence.”

“Testing physical entry by assessors is not an authorized assessment method.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A/B: Interviews or SOP reviews may provide supporting context, but they do not prove operational

badge restrictions.

D: Assessors are prohibited from attempting physical bypass or entry tests.

Question #:118 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] An Assessment Team is holding a discussion with the system administrator at the OSC to understand their process for ensuring unauthorized users are not able to access CUI.

Which assessment method is being utilized?

A. Test method

B. Observe method

C. Examine method

D. Interview method

Answer: D

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) defines four methods: Examine, Interview, Test, and Observe.

Interview Method: Involves discussions with personnel to gather evidence about the whe implementation of practices.

In this case, the CCA is discussing with the system administrator to understand processes, which clearly aligns with the Interview method.

Extract:

“Interview: The assessor uses discussions with personnel to obtain evidence about how practices are implemented within the OSC’s environment.”

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2; CMMC Assessment Process (CAP).

Question #:119 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods]

During the assessment of a company, the CCA learns that 50% of employees work from home using remote access. After reviewing the Access Control policy and audit logs, the CCA is unsure how the system ensures only employees with correct privileges can access CUI. The CCA decides a Test of functionality is required. Which question is of the LEAST concern to the CCA?

A. Are remote access sessions necessary?

B. Are remote access sessions permitted?

C. Are remote access sessions monitored?

D. Are the types of permitted remote access identified?

Answer: A

Explanation
Under AC.L2-3.1.12: Remote Access, assessors must verify that all remote access sessions are identified, authorized, controlled, and monitored. Whether remote access is “necessary” is a business decision, not an assessment concern. The assessor is concerned with whether it is properly controlled and implemented, not with the business justification for its existence.

Exact extracts:

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if:• remote access methods are identified;• remote access is authorized prior to allowing such connections;• remote access sessions are controlled;• remote access sessions are monitored.”

“The requirement does not assess business necessity of remote access, only its security and authorization.”

Why the other options are important:

B: Authorization (permitted) must be verified.

C: Monitoring of remote sessions is mandatory.

D: Permitted methods must be identified (e.g., VPN, VDI, etc.). References:

Question #:120 - [CMMC Assessment Process] While scoring the evidence for a particular CMMC practice, the Certified Assessor notes that one of the practice objectives is NOT MET, thereby scoring the entire practice as NOT MET. The OSC Assessment Official disagrees with the Certified Assessor’s decision, and they both take the dispute to the Lead Assessor, who is unable to resolve the issue to the OSC’s satisfaction.

How will this dispute be settled?

A. The Lead Assessor is the final arbiter of the dispute.

B. The OSC can supply adequate proof to the Cyber-AB to overturn the decision.

C. The Certified Assessor is certified and, as such, the decision will stand.

D. The Lead Assessor will present the dispute to the C3PAO Official, who will make a ruling.

Answer: D

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) specifies that when disputes cannot be resolved by the Lead Assessor, they must be elevated to the C3PAO Official, who has authority to make the final decision. Extract:

“Unresolved disputes between the OSC and the Assessment Team must be elevated to the C3PAO Official for final resolution.”

Therefore, the C3PAO Official is the final arbiter in such disputes.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:121 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

The Lead Assessor is reviewing the Assessment Plan to identify people for interviews regarding a specific Level 2 practice. Some OSC personnel previously interviewed provided only brief answers without meaningful verification. What can the Lead Assessor do to improve this situation going forward?

A. Ensure the people from the training matrix are made available

B. Ensure and verify confidentiality and non-attribution of responses

C. Ensure the respondents sign a non-disclosure agreement for the OSC

D. Ensure and verify the responses map to the documented artifacts

Answer: B

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process emphasizes the importance of confidentiality and non-attribution in interviews to ensure OSC personnel provide candid, accurate information. Interviewees may give shallow or evasive answers if they fear attribution. Assuring confidentiality and non-attribution improves the quality and reliability of responses.

Exact extracts:

“The assessment team must ensure confidentiality and non-attribution during interviews.”

“Responses should be validated against evidence, but the quality of input depends on establishing a safe

environment for candor.”

“Non-attribution is critical to elicit detailed and honest responses.” Why the other options are incorrect:

A: Training matrices identify who is trained, not who should be interviewed.

C: NDAs are not a CCA responsibility — they are contractual, not assessment requirements.

D: Mapping to artifacts is part of correlation after interviews, but does not solve the problem of poor

interview responses.

Question #:122 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

Which of the following can be taken into consideration when assessing AC.L2-3.1.3 Privacy & Security Notices?

A. System use notifications during system log-in

B. Alerts received from Intrusion Detection and Protection devices

C. Posters in the workplace warning of the dangers of phishing and shoulder-surfing

D. Sending out notices in email reminding employees to be conscious of security concerns

Answer: A

Explanation
Practice AC.L2-3.1.3 requires that users are presented with privacy and security notices (system use notifications) at the point of system log-in to ensure that they are aware of authorized usage and monitoring. Extract:

“Display privacy and security notices (system use notifications) before granting system access.”

Posters, alerts, or general awareness messages do not satisfy this practice because they are not tied directly to system access.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, AC.L2-3.1.3.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:123 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] Does CMMC Level 2 require that a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) hold a FedRAMP HIGH authorization hosted in a government community cloud (GCC)?

A. No. The CSP can obtain a FedRAMP MODERATE equivalency.

B. No. The CSP must hold a FedRAMP MODERATE authorization.

C. Yes. FedRAMP HIGH is required for CUI data controls due to the sensitive nature of the Defense Industrial Base systems.

D. Yes. FedRAMP HIGH authorization demonstrates the CSP compliance with NIST SP 800-53 and SP 800-171 control requirements.

Answer: B

Explanation
CMMC Level 2 requires CSPs that process, store, or transmit CUI to meet FedRAMP Moderate (or equivalent) authorization, not FedRAMP High. FedRAMP High is not a CMMC requirement but may be required by contract or specific agencies.

Exact Extracts:

DoD CMMC Scoping Guide: “External Cloud Service Providers must meet FedRAMP Moderate equivalency when storing, processing, or transmitting CUI.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “The baseline requirement for CUI in cloud environments is FedRAMP Moderate; higher levels may be contractually required.”

Why other options are not correct:

A: Equivalency is allowed, but only to FedRAMP Moderate level.

C/D: Incorrect, because CMMC Level 2 does not mandate FedRAMP High.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: External Service Providers and FedRAMP Moderate equivalency requirements.

DoD Cloud Computing SRG (referenced in CMMC documentation): CUI requires FedRAMP Moderate baseline.

Question #:124 - [CMMC Assessment Process] Phase 2 of the CMMC Assessment Process specifies that the Assessment Team shall generate the final recommended assessment results. The status and recommended scores of the implemented CMMC practices are collected throughout the assessment and are reviewed with the OSC during the final daily review. What are the key sequential subphases that support the generation of final recommended assessment results?

A. Determine final practice MET/NOT MET/NA results Create, finalize, and record recommended final findings Resolve assessment findings disputes

B. Validate preliminary recommended findings and scores Resolve assessment findings disputes Submit, package, and archive assessment documentation

C. Create, finalize, and record recommended final findings Execute POA&M review

Resolve assessment findings disputes

D. Determine final practice MET/NOT MET/NA results Validate OSC POA&M Create, finalize, and record recommended final findings

Answer: A

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Phase 2 – Conduct the Assessment defines the subphases for generating final recommended results. The steps are:

Determine final practice MET/NOT MET/NA results

Create, finalize, and record recommended final findings

Resolve assessment findings disputes Extract:

“The assessment team determines the final practice status, records recommended findings, and resolves disputes with the OSC prior to finalizing recommended results.”

Question #:125 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] The OSC’s network consists of a single network switch that connects all devices. This includes the OSC’s OT equipment, which processes CUI. The OT controller requires an unsupported operating system.

What can the Lead Assessor BEST conclude about the overall compliance with MA.L2-3.7.1: Perform Maintenance?

A. It is MET only if every asset that is not a Specialized Asset is maintained.

B. It is MET only if the environments are demarcated on the baseline diagram.

C. It is NOT MET because industrial equipment should not be processing CUI.

D. It is NOT MET because the OSC has not managed the risk of a CUI system being outdated.

Answer: D

Explanation
MA.L2-3.7.1 (Perform Maintenance) requires that maintenance activities and risks associated with outdated or unsupported systems be managed. Unsupported systems create a security risk if not mitigated, particularly when they process CUI.

Extract:

“Maintenance must be performed and documented to ensure continued secure operation. When systems cannot be updated or patched due to technical limitations, the OSC must implement and document risk mitigation strategies.”

Because the OSC has not demonstrated risk management for the outdated OT system, the practice is NOT MET.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, MA.L2-3.7.1.

Question #:126 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

An OSC has a large multi-building facility. One building is used as the OSC’s data center. A guard is stationed at the entrance to the data center. A vendor engineer comes onsite to perform maintenance on the storage array in the data center. The guard knows the engineer well and has the engineer fill out the visitor log with the contact person’s name and phone number, the reason for the visit, and the date and time. Since the guard has known the engineer for many years, what is the BEST step the guard should take?

A. Call the contact person and let her know that the engineer is onsite and give the engineer a temporary badge to enter the data center.

B. Call the operations center to give the engineer temporary access to enter the data center and escort the engineer to the array and leave.

C. Call the contact person to have her come down and escort the engineer to the array and stay with the engineer until the maintenance is complete.

D. Call the operations center to have one of the admins escort the engineer to the array and stay with the engineer until the maintenance is complete.

Answer: C

Explanation
The Physical Protection (PE) practices require that visitors to facilities where CUI is processed must be escorted at all times by an authorized individual. Familiarity or long-term knowledge of the visitor does not remove the requirement.

Extract from PE.L2-3.10.3:

“Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity to ensure they do not access areas or information for which they are not authorized.”

Thus, the correct action is for the contact person (the engineer’s point of contact) to escort the engineer during the entire maintenance activity.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, PE.L2-3.10.3.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:127 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

The assessment team has divided responsibilities to review portions of the OSC’s scope, including the Host Unit, the specific enclave, and supporting teams such as a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). During evidence review, the team notices that MSSP personnel answered interview questions somewhat differently than OSC personnel. To clarify this inconsistency, the Lead Assessor decides to take all the following steps EXCEPT:

A. Review the network diagrams.

B. Review the agreement with the MSSP.

C. Review the notes to determine what was different.

D. Review interview questionnaire consistency.

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CMMC Assessment Process): The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) requires assessors to collect, analyze, and reconcile evidence using triangulation (examine, interview, test) to confirm whether requirements are MET or NOT MET. When inconsistencies arise, the assessor must go back to objective evidence such as diagrams, contracts, and notes.

Why Reviewing Network Diagrams Helps (supports A): Network diagrams provide authoritative evidence of scope, data flows, and system boundaries, which helps clarify whether the MSSP’s services were accurately described.

Why Reviewing MSSP Agreements Helps (supports B): Agreements (such as interconnection security agreements or service-level agreements) define shared responsibilities and confirm how the MSSP supports security controls. This evidence is critical to resolving inconsistent testimony.

Why Reviewing Notes Helps (supports C): Notes from previous interviews allow the team to pinpoint where answers diverged. This is a valid method of evidence review and aligns with CAP guidance on documenting interviews.

Why Interview Questionnaire Consistency is NOT the Correct Step (refutes D): The CAP emphasizes resolving inconsistencies through additional evidence, not by adjusting or re-checking the questionnaire itself. The consistency of the questionnaire is irrelevant — what matters is reconciling the evidence provided by both the OSC and MSSP. Thus, this is the action the Lead Assessor would NOT take.

Assessment Guidance Extract (CAP):

“When conflicting evidence is observed, the assessment team must review technical documentation, agreements, and notes to identify the root cause and determine whether additional clarification is required.”

“The interview instrument itself is not a tool for reconciling inconsistencies; rather, objective evidence must be used.”

Question #:128 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] During discussions with an OSC, the assessment team learned that many employees often need to work from remote locations and, as a result, are permitted to access the organization’s internal networks from those remote locations. To ensure secure remote access requirements are being met, remote access sessions need NOT be:

A. Validated

B. Identified

C. Permitted

D. Controlled

Answer: A

Explanation
CMMC Level 2 control AC.L2-3.1.12: Remote Access requires that all methods of remote access be authorized, monitored, and controlled to protect CUI when accessed from external locations. The assessment guide specifies that assessors must verify that remote sessions are identified, permitted, and controlled. There is no requirement for remote access sessions to be “validated” — this is not part of the assessment objectives for this practice.

Exact extracts:

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if:• remote access methods are identified;• remote access is authorized prior to allowing such connections;• remote access sessions are controlled; and• cryptographic mechanisms are employed to protect confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.”

“Remote access to organizational systems is accomplished through the use of managed access control points. A detailed record of all remote access sessions is maintained, and the sessions are subject to monitoring and control.”

Why the other options are required:

Identified (B): OSCs must identify all remote access methods in use.

Permitted (C): Remote access must be explicitly authorized before it is allowed.

Controlled (D): Sessions must be controlled (e.g., via encryption, multifactor authentication, and monitoring).

Validated (A): Not a required assessment objective; it is a distractor option. References (CCA documents / Study Guide):

Question #:129 - [Scoping and System Boundaries]

While conducting a CMMC Level 2 Assessment for a small waveguide manufacturer, the client provides a copy of their CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment that their senior official has recently approved and uploaded to the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS). What type of information may be covered within the Level 1 Self-Assessment that is OUTSIDE the scope of a Level 2 assessment?

A. CUI in paper format

B. FCI within the CUI production enclave

C. FCI data within the description in the contractor self-assessment

D. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) shredded by an approved vendor

Answer: C

Explanation
CMMC Levels and Scope:

Level 1: Protects Federal Contract Information (FCI) under FAR 52.204-21 (17 basic safeguarding requirements).

Level 2: Protects Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) under NIST SP 800-171 (110 practices).

Why C is Correct: The Level 1 self-assessment covers FCI-related practices. Since Level 2 focuses

exclusively on CUI environments, FCI-only requirements from the Level 1 self-assessment fall

outside the scope of the Level 2 assessment.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A (CUI in paper): Still in scope at Level 2 (CUI applies to both digital and physical formats). B (FCI within CUI enclave): If FCI is processed within the enclave, it is covered by Level 2. D (SCI): Classified information is entirely out of scope of CMMC; however, it is not relevant to Level 1 self-assessment either, making C the more precise choice.

Question #:130 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC seeking Level 2 certification has recently configured system auditing capabilities for all systems within the assessment scope. The audit logs are generated based on the required events and contain the correct content that the organization has defined.

Which of the following BEST describes the next system auditing objective that the organization should define?

A. Centralized audit log collection

B. Integration of all system audit logs

C. Review and update of logged events

D. Retention requirements for audit records

Answer: C

Explanation
The next step after configuring audit logs and ensuring event content is correct is to periodically review and update the logged events to maintain alignment with evolving security requirements and risks.

Extract from AU.L2-3.3.2 & AU.L2-3.3.7:

“Organizations must review and update audit log events periodically to ensure they continue to support accountability and monitoring objectives.”

While centralized collection and retention are important, the next required objective per progression is review and update of logged events.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:131 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC processes data in its owned data center. The data center includes a very early smoke detection apparatus (VESDA). The apparatus only captures log information from its sensors around the data center. It is not intended, nor capable of, processing CUI. The VESDA is on a separate VLAN and is in a separate locked room in the data center.

Should the assessor agree that the VESDA is out-of-scope?

A. Yes. The VESDA is physically and logically separated from the other data center equipment, and it is not intended nor capable of processing CUI.

B. No. Even though the sensors are out-of-scope, the VESDA could provide access to the outside network if sensors were misused, and CUI could be exfiltrated.

C. No. Even though the VESDA controller is in a locked room and on a separate VLAN, the VESDA is an essential security function as an early warning system.

D. Yes. The VESDA serves a non-data processing purpose and is only connected to sensors. Sensors are out-of-scope, so the VESDA is out-of-scope.

Answer: A

Explanation
The CMMC Scoping Guidance allows assets to be classified as Out-of-Scope if:

They are physically/logically isolated, and They cannot process, store, or transmit CUI.

Extract:

“Out-of-Scope assets are those that cannot process, store, or transmit CUI and are physically or logically separated from CUI assets.”

The VESDA system only monitors environmental conditions and does not interact with CUI. Its segregation supports an out-of-scope classification.

Question #:132 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A manufacturing company is seeking Level 2 certification. The loading docks are currently accessible directly from the company’s main parking lot, which may lead to unauthorized access to facilities. Based on this information, how should this method be modified to BEST meet Level 2 requirements?

A. Implement physical perimeter controls, such as turnstiles, to limit access.

B. Require visitors to check in at the reception desk and maintain a visitor log.

C. Implement physical perimeter controls, such as cameras, to limit access to only authorized personnel.

D. Implement physical perimeter controls, such as a gate with a badge system, to limit access to only authorized personnel.

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: PE.L2-3.10.3 — “Control physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments.”

Why D is Correct: A gate with a badge system represents preventive perimeter control that ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas (e.g., loading docks). This directly aligns with Level 2 physical protection requirements.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A (Turnstiles): More relevant for internal building entry, not loading docks.

B (Visitor log): Supports accountability, but does not prevent unauthorized entry.

C (Cameras): Provides monitoring but not control — surveillance alone does not restrict access. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:133 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC is preparing for assessment. Which item of evidence would show the OSC’s efforts to restrict physical access within the OSC’s environment?

A. VPN configuration

B. Switch configuration files

C. Network architecture drawings

D. Documented OSC procedures

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: PE.L2-3.10.1 — “Limit physical access to organizational information systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.”

Why D is Correct: Documented procedures describing physical access restrictions (badge policies, visitor management, locked server rooms, guard post orders) serve as primary evidence that access is managed and enforced. Assessors can then corroborate via interviews and observation.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A (VPN configuration): Relates to remote logical access, not physical security.

B (Switch configs): Technical network controls, not physical access.

C (Architecture drawings): Show logical/system design, not physical entry restrictions. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:134 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] NIST SP 800-171A specifies the assessment methods for defining the nature and the extent of a CCA’s actions. What is the purpose of the test assessment method?

A. To review, inspect, observe, or analyze assessment objects

B. To review compliance with an applicable standard and security assurance claims

C. To exercise assessment objects under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior

D. To execute a systematic process, procedure, or technique for obtaining security assurance evidence and consistently verifying security assurance claims

Answer: C

Explanation
The test assessment method means the assessor actively exercises or stimulates the system (or object) under defined conditions to compare actual results with expected behavior. This goes beyond review or observation and involves hands-on validation.

Exact Extracts:

NIST SP 800-171A: “The test method is the process of exercising assessment objects under specified

conditions to compare actual with expected behavior.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “Testing requires assessors to observe the execution of functions,

mechanisms, or activities to confirm effectiveness.” Why the other options are not correct:

A: This defines Examine (not Test).

B: This aligns with Interview or compliance review, not Test.

D: This is a generic definition but does not capture the essence of Test (direct execution under

conditions).

Question #:135 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] A company employs an encrypted VPN to enhance confidentiality over remote connections. The CCA reads a document describing the VPN. It states the VPN allows automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions, helps detect cyberattacks, and supports auditing of remote access to ensure compliance with CMMC requirements.

What document is the CCA MOST LIKELY reviewing to see how these VPNs are controlled and monitored?

A. Access Control Policy

B. Media Protection Policy

C. Audit and Accountability Policy

D. Configuration Management Policy

Answer: A

Explanation
The Access Control (AC) domain governs remote access, privileged access, and VPN controls. Documents describing how VPNs are controlled, monitored, and restricted fall under the Access Control Policy. Extract:

“Access Control practices include the management of remote connections, monitoring of sessions, and enforcement of VPN controls.”

Thus, the correct document is the Access Control Policy.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, AC.L2-3.1.x.

Question #:136 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] In validating the OSC’s implementation of AC.L2-3.1.16: Wireless Access Authorization, the CCA observes various personal and non-enterprise devices connected to the OSC’s Wi-Fi. Because organizations handle wireless access differently, the CCA must locate evidence showing who has ultimate authority over wireless access. Which authority is acceptable for authorizing wireless access?

A. The CEO mandating IT to add their personal phone to the company Wi-Fi

B. A written policy executed by the CEO listing the pre-authorization requirements for Wi-Fi connectivity

C. The CEO emailing the company instructing everyone to put personal devices on the company Wi-Fi

D. A detailed document from the head of IT with instructions on how to connect to the guest Wi-Fi network

Answer: B

Explanation
CMMC Level 2 requires that wireless access be formally authorized based on management-approved policy and criteria. The Assessment Guide specifies that “management guidelines form the basis for the requirements that must be met prior to authorizing a wireless connection.” Therefore, a written policy executed by the CEO, which defines pre-authorization requirements, constitutes proper evidence of authorization. Informal emails or IT connection instructions do not meet this requirement.

Exact extracts:

“Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections.”

“Assessment Objectives … Determine if: [a] wireless access points are identified; and [b] wireless access is authorized prior to allowing such connections.”

“Guidelines from management form the basis for the requirements that must be met prior to authorizing a wireless connection. These guidelines may include the following: • types of devices, such as corporate or privately owned equipment; • configuration requirements of the devices; and • authorization requirements before granting such connections.”

Assessment method – Examine: “Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless implementation and usage (including restrictions); wireless access authorizations …”

Why the other options are unacceptable:

A and C are ad-hoc instructions from the CEO, not a formal management policy establishing authorization criteria.

D is an IT-authored instruction document, not a management-level authorization policy.

Question #:137 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] The OSC prints out documents it receives via email that are marked as CUI. According to MP.L2-3.8.4: Media Markings, what should the Assessor expect to see on the printouts?

A. A red stamp that states the document contains CUI

B. Written limitations to the distribution of the CUI within the OSC

C. The original markings that were on the document emailed to the OSC

D. The original markings from the document and a distribution list with limitations

Answer: C

Explanation
MP.L2-3.8.4 requires that CUI markings follow the media, meaning when electronic documents are printed, the original markings must carry over to the hard copy. Distribution lists or colored stamps are not specifically required.

Extract:

“Mark media containing CUI with the CUI designation indicators as required. When converting CUI from one medium to another, the original markings must be retained.”

Thus, the assessor should expect to see the original markings carried onto the printouts. Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, MP.L2-3.8.4.

Question #:138 - [CMMC Assessment Process] While conducting a Level 2 Assessment, the Assessment Team begins reviewing assessment objects. The team identifies concerns with several of the objects presented. Which artifacts would require the MOST verification?

A. Current artifacts produced by individuals performing the work

B. Artifacts created 18 months ago by individuals performing the work

C. Current artifacts produced by individuals that work for a separate entity of the company

D. Artifacts created 18 months ago by individuals that work for a separate entity of the company

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement (CAP – Evidence Validity): Evidence must be relevant, reliable, and timely. Artifacts from separate entities or outdated sources require extra scrutiny.

Why D is Correct: The least reliable evidence is old (18 months) and produced by individuals not part of the OSC entity being assessed. Such artifacts require the most verification to determine applicability.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Strongest evidence (current and from OSC staff).

B: Outdated, but still from OSC staff (more reliable than outside entity).

C: Current, but external (still stronger than outdated + external).

Question #:139 - [CMMC Assessment Process]

The Lead Assessor has conducted an assessment for an OSC. The OSC’s practices have been scored and preliminary results validated. Based on this information, what is the NEXT logical step?

A. Determine CMMC Assessment scope.

B. Deliver recommended assessment results.

C. Consider additional evidence and record gaps.

D. Create, finalize, and record recommended final findings.

Answer: D

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: CAP – Assessment Execution Phase.

Why D is Correct: After scoring and validating preliminary results, the next step is to finalize and record recommended final findings for submission. This closes the assessment process and supports certification decisions.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

A: Scope determination occurs in planning, not after validation.

B: Results are delivered after finalization, not immediately after validation.

C: Considering additional evidence occurs during data collection, before validation.

Question #:140 - [CMMC Assessment Process] A company is undergoing a CMMC Level 2 Assessment. The Assessment Team is planning and preparing the assessment. Who is responsible for identifying methods, techniques, and responsibilities for collecting, managing, and reviewing evidence?

A. Lead Assessor

B. Assessment Team Member

C. C3PAO Quality Oversight Manager

D. CMMC Quality Assurance Professional

Answer: A

Explanation
The Lead Assessor is responsible for managing the assessment team and planning the assessment, including defining the methods, techniques, and responsibilities for collecting, managing, and reviewing evidence. Team members execute assigned tasks, but the Lead Assessor provides direction and oversight.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “The Lead Assessor is responsible for the management of the assessment, including defining evidence collection methods, techniques, and responsibilities.”

“The assessment team members carry out activities as directed by the Lead Assessor.”

“The C3PAO Quality Oversight and CMMC Quality Assurance are post-assessment quality functions, not evidence planning functions.”

Why other options are not correct:

B: Team members execute tasks but do not define methods and responsibilities.

C: Quality Oversight Managers review assessments after completion, not during planning.

D: CMMC Quality Assurance Professionals conduct QA on assessments, not evidence planning. References:

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: Assessment planning roles and responsibilities (pp. 4–6).

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:141 - [CMMC Assessment Process] In completing the assessment of practices in the Access Control (AC) domain, a CCA scored AC.L2-3.1.15: Privileged Remote Access as NOT MET. The OSC was notified of this deficiency at the end of day two of the assessment. On day five of the assessment, the OSC’s Assessment Official contacted the CCA to provide evidence that the deficiencies have been corrected.

What is the CCA’s NEXT step?

A. This practice is not eligible for deficiency correction and should be scored as NOT MET.

B. This practice is not eligible for deficiency correction, should be scored as NOT MET, and reevaluated during a POA&M Close-Out Assessment.

C. This practice is eligible for deficiency correction and should be scored as MET but must be reevaluated during a POA&M Close-Out Assessment.

D. This practice is eligible for deficiency correction, should be scored as NOT MET, and evaluated during the Limited Deficiency Correction evaluation.

Answer: A

Explanation
The CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) states that deficiency correction is not permitted during the assessment. Practices must be evaluated based on their implementation at the time of assessment. If the OSC corrects deficiencies after assessment activities have begun, the changes cannot be considered in the scoring.

Extract:

“Deficiency correction during the assessment is not permitted. Practices are scored based on evidence available at the time of assessment activities.”

Thus, the correct next step is to score the practice as NOT MET.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), Phase 2 Rules.

Question #:142 - [CMMC Assessment Process] A company is seeking Level 2 CMMC certification. During the Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Evaluation, the Lead Assessor must decide whether the company can move to a POA&M review. Which condition will result in the Lead Assessor recommending that the OSC’s practice deficiencies move to a POA&M review?

A. A final score below 88

B. A final score of 110

C. A final score of 80 or better

D. A final score of 88/110 or better

Answer: D

Explanation
For CMMC Level 2, an OSC must score at least 88 out of 110 practices (80%) to qualify for use of POA&Ms. Practices on the DoD’s Authorized POA&M List may then be deferred, but only if the OSC meets the 88-point threshold and no high-weight practices are failed.

Exact extracts:

“Organizations must score at least 88 out of 110 (80%) to be eligible for POA&Ms.” “POA&Ms may only be applied to a limited subset of practices designated by DoD.” “Failure to reach the 88-point threshold results in an assessment failure.”

Why other options are incorrect:

A: Below 88 is automatic fail.

B: 110/110 is full compliance (no POA&M needed).

C: 80 is a distractor; 88 is the actual DoD threshold.

Question #:143 - [CMMC Ecosystem and Roles] An OSC seeking Level 2 certification is migrating to a fully cloud-based environment. The organization wants to select a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that can share responsibilities for CMMC Level 2 requirements. Assume both CSPs can equally provide the technical capabilities and business value required.

CSP A has SOC 2 certification and is California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Health Insurance

Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant.

CSP B has SOC 2 and FedRAMP Moderate certifications.

Based on this information, which CSP is MOST LIKELY to be acceptable?

A. CSP A

B. CSP B

C. Both CSP A and B

D. Neither CSP A nor B

Answer: B

Explanation
When an OSC leverages cloud providers in a CMMC Level 2 assessment, the provider should have FedRAMP Moderate or higher authorization to align with NIST SP 800-171 requirements. SOC 2, HIPAA, or CCPA compliance do not demonstrate federal-level assurance for protecting CUI. Thus, CSP B is the most appropriate choice.

Exact extracts:

“Cloud service providers that process, store, or transmit CUI should be FedRAMP Moderate Authorized or equivalent.”

“Assessors must verify evidence of FedRAMP authorization or comparable assurance before determining that OSC reliance on the provider is acceptable.”

Why the other options are incorrect:

A: SOC 2, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance do not equate to CMMC-required federal assurance.

C: Only FedRAMP-authorized providers meet the requirement, so both are not acceptable.

D: CSP B does meet the criteria.

Question #:144 - [Assessment Objectives and Methods] An assessor is trying to determine if an OSC performs scans of their information system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded or executed.

Which evidence is LEAST LIKELY to help this assessor?

A. System configuration settings

B. System Information and Integrity Policy

C. Alerts from the anti-virus software

D. Interviews with personnel with configuration management responsibility

Answer: B

Explanation
To verify scanning (such as anti-virus and file integrity functions), the strongest evidence includes system configurations, AV alerts/logs, and interviews with technical staff. A policy document (System Information and Integrity Policy) provides intent but not actual implementation proof, making it the least helpful.

Extract:

“Policies provide documented intent, but assessors must validate actual implementation through configuration reviews, alerts/logs, and personnel interviews.”

Thus, the policy alone is the least useful evidence for confirming scans are actually performed.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, SI.L2-3.14.x.

------------------------------------------------------------

Question #:145 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] An OSC seeking Level 2 certification is working with an ESP. The organization is trying to determine if the ESP is considered within the assessment and is reviewing the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the organization and the ESP. Which SLA component should be taken into consideration to determine if the ESP is within the assessment scope?

A. Services

B. Intervals

C. Penalties

D. Measurements

Answer: A

Explanation
The determining factor for whether an ESP is in scope is the services provided. If the ESP provides services that process, store, or transmit CUI or provide security protection functions, then the ESP is within scope. Other SLA components (intervals, penalties, measurements) are irrelevant to scope determination.

Exact Extracts:

CMMC Scoping Guide: “External Service Providers that provide services involving the storage,

processing, or transmission of CUI or provide Security Protection Assets are considered in scope.”

“The OSC must identify in the SSP which services are provided by ESPs and how compliance is

achieved.”

Why other options are not correct:

B (Intervals): Refers to timing of services, not scope relevance.

C (Penalties): Contract penalties are unrelated to CMMC scope.

D (Measurements): SLAs metrics do not determine scope.

Question #:146 - [CMMC Domains and Practices]

An organization’s password policy includes these requirements:

Passwords must be at least 8 characters in length.

Passwords must contain at least one uppercase character, one lowercase character, and one numeric digit.

Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.

When a password is changed, none of the previous 3 passwords can be reused.

Per IA.L2-3.5.7: Password Complexity, what requirement is missing from this password policy?

A. It does not require MFA.

B. It does not include a list of prohibited passwords.

C. It does not specify a minimum change of character requirement.

D. It does not require the password to contain at least one special character.

Answer: D

Explanation
IA.L2-3.5.7 requires password complexity rules that include uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters. The given policy addresses three requirements but does not mandate at least one special character. Extract:

“Enforce password complexity by requiring combinations of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.”

Thus, the missing requirement is the use of a special character.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, IA.L2-3.5.7.

Question #:147 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] A company has multiple sites with employees at each site that must access the company’s CUI network from their remote locations. The company has set up a single access point for all employees to access the network. What is the MOST significant factor in determining whether the security on this single access point is adequate?

A. Remote access is secured and monitored.

B. Physical access is monitored and controlled.

C. The security requirements for CUI and FCI are documented.

D.

D. The remote personnel have notification procedures regarding connection issues.

Answer: A

Explanation
Applicable Requirement: AC.L2-3.1.12 and AC.L2-3.1.14 — “Monitor and control remote access sessions” and “Route remote access through managed access control points.”

Why A is Correct: For a single centralized access point, the most critical control is that remote access sessions are properly secured and monitored to prevent unauthorized access to CUI systems. This ensures both confidentiality and integrity of remote connections.

Why Other Options Are Insufficient:

B: Physical access controls protect on-site systems but do not address remote connection security.

C: Documentation alone is not sufficient; actual monitoring and security enforcement are required.

D: Notification procedures relate to incident handling, not adequacy of access point security. References (CCA Official Sources):

Question #:148 - [CMMC Assessment Process] During a company’s assessment, the CCA notices that the server room door is kept open with a fan in the entryway because the cooling system is inadequate and the machines are overheating. According to the physical protection policy, the server room’s keypad is the mechanism for managing and controlling access to this equipment, and only the IT team should have access to the server room. However, with the door open, the keypad is not necessary, and anyone can enter the room.

The CCA asks the IT manager how access to this room is protected while the door is open. Which response would allow the company to still meet the physical security requirement?

A. “Only employees are allowed in this area.”

B. “We trust our employees not to enter the room if they are not supposed to.”

C. “The server is located inside another room that only the IT team has access to.”

D. “The CEO emailed all employees that the server room door would be kept open but only the IT team should enter.”

Answer: C

Explanation
The Physical Protection (PE) Domain requires implementation of physical access controls to prevent unauthorized access to CUI systems. Simply trusting employees or sending communications is not sufficient. However, if the server is located inside a secondary restricted room that only the IT team can access, then adequate physical protection controls are still in place.

Extract from PE.L2-3.10.x (Physical Protection Practices):

“Organizations must limit physical access to systems, equipment, and environments that process, store, or transmit CUI to authorized individuals only.”

Thus, placing the server within an additional restricted access-controlled room ensures compliance, even if the outer door is propped open for cooling.

Reference: CMMC Assessment Guide, Level 2, Physical Protection (PE) practices.

Question #:149 - [CMMC Domains and Practices] An OSC leases several servers and rack space in a FedRAMP MODERATE authorized colocation data center. Additional servers operate in a LAN room within the company’s facility. Both facilities are within the OSC’s assessment boundary. In order to assess the physical protection of the environment, the Assessor MUST physically examine the visitor and access controls in place in the:

A. Data center

B. OSC’s facility

C. OSC’s facility and the data center

D. OSC’s facility and the data center’s customer relationship management regarding physical security

Answer: C

Explanation
Both the OSC’s on-premise LAN room and the leased colocation data center are in-scope because they contain systems that process, store, or transmit CUI. Assessors must physically examine visitor and access controls at both locations to confirm compliance with PE practices.

Exact Extracts:

PE.L2-3.10.1: “Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.”

PE.L2-3.10.3: “Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.”

CMMC Assessment Guide: “Assessors must validate physical protections at all in-scope facilities where CUI assets reside.”

CMMC Scoping Guide: “Physical protection applies to all facilities within the CMMC Assessment Scope, including colocation facilities.”

Why the other options are not correct:

A/B: Reviewing only one facility is insufficient; both are in scope.

D: Customer relationship management reviews are not substitutes for physical examination by assessors. References:

Question #:150 - [Scoping and System Boundaries] A company describes its organization as having two systems. One system, System Org, covers the entire organization and allows instant messaging, email, and Internet activity. The other system, System CUI, is used for processing, storing, and transmitting CUI data. System CUI interfaces with System Org through security mechanisms and a firewall.

The CMMC Assessment is being done on System CUI only.

What is the BEST way to describe System CUI?

A. CUI Assets

B. In-Scope Assets

C. Out-of-Scope Assets

D. CUI Assets and Security Protection Assets

Answer: A

Explanation
Per the CMMC Scoping Guidance, CUI Assets are those that process, store, or transmit CUI. Since System CUI is the system handling CUI data, it must be categorized as CUI Assets.

Extract:

“CUI Assets are any assets that process, store, or transmit CUI. These assets are in-scope for assessment and must meet CMMC practice requirements.”

Thus, the best classification for System CUI is CUI Assets. Reference: CMMC Scoping Guidance – CUI Assets.
