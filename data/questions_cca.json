Security Protection Assets are part of the CMMC Assessment Scope and are assessed against Level 2 security requirements that are relevant to the capabilities provided.”\n\n“Contractor Risk Managed Assets are not required to be physically or logically separated from CUI Assets… If documentation or other findings raise questions about these assets, the assessor can conduct a limited check to identify deficiencies.”\n\n“Separation… is required only for Out-of-Scope Assets. Isolation can be achieved… by implementing subnetworks with firewalls or other boundary protection devices.”\n\n“The CMMC Assessment Scope includes all assets in the OSA’s environment that will be assessed… OSAs will be required to provide a network diagram of the CMMC Assessment Scope to facilitate scoping discussions during pre-assessment.”\n\n“An OSC can obtain a Level 2 certification assessment for an entire enterprise network or for a specific enclave(s), depending upon how the CMMC Assessment Scope is defined…”\n\nWhy the other options are not correct:\n\nA (locked cases): Physical movement of materials does not establish scope. Scoping is determined by CUI flow and security protection assets, not incidental observation of personnel activities.\n\nB (underground passageway): Physical tunnels or building connections do not affect scope unless they result in shared IT/security functions.\n\nD (HR location): HR is not a SPA because it does not provide security functions to protect CUI. Unless HR systems process or store CUI directly, they remain out of scope.\n\nCMMC Assessment Scope – Level 2, Version 2.13 (Scoping Guide): Asset Categories, SPA definitions and examples; CRMA limited-check language; Separation requirements; network diagram requirements (pp. 3–13).\n\nCMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13: Assessment scope, enclave validation, and assessor methods (pp. 1–4, 8–10).",

The company’s use of firewalls and a connection allow-list directly addresses this requirement.\n\nFull Control of External Systems Not Required (refutes D): The definition of “external systems” clarifies that organizations typically do not have direct supervision or authority over those systems.

When inconsistencies arise, the assessor must go back to objective evidence such as diagrams, contracts, and notes.\n\nWhy Reviewing Network Diagrams Helps (supports A): Network diagrams provide authoritative evidence of scope, data flows, and system boundaries, which helps clarify whether the MSSP’s services were accurately described.\n\nWhy Reviewing MSSP Agreements Helps (supports B): Agreements (such as interconnection security agreements or service-level agreements) define shared responsibilities and confirm how the MSSP supports security controls. This evidence is critical to resolving inconsistent testimony.\n\nWhy Reviewing Notes Helps (supports C): Notes from previous interviews allow the team to pinpoint where answers diverged. This is a valid method of evidence review and aligns with CAP guidance on documenting interviews.\n\nWhy Interview Questionnaire Consistency is NOT the Correct Step (refutes D): The CAP emphasizes resolving inconsistencies through additional evidence, not by adjusting or re-checking the questionnaire itself. The consistency of the questionnaire is irrelevant — what matters is reconciling the evidence provided by both the OSC and MSSP. Thus, this is the action the Lead Assessor would NOT take.\n\nAssessment Guidance Extract (CAP):\n\n“When conflicting evidence is observed, the assessment team must review technical documentation, agreements, and notes to identify the root cause and determine whether additional clarification is required.”\n\n“The interview instrument itself is not a tool for reconciling inconsistencies; rather, objective evidence must be used.”\n\nCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) v1.0 — Section 3: Conducting the Assessment (Interview, Evidence, Triangulation, and Conflict Resolution) CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2, Version 2.13 — Guidance on the role of External Service Providers (MSSPs) and use of documented agreements as evidence NIST SP 800-171A — General assessment methodology: reconcile evidence using examine, interview, and test methods",
