D. Interview Answer: B

Explanation

The CMMC Assessment Process uses three methods: Examine, Interview, and Test. The method that involves analyzing artifacts (documents, system configurations, records, logs, etc.) is Examine.

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CMMC Assessment Guide: “Examine consists of reviewing, inspecting, or analyzing assessment objects such as documents, system configurations, or other artifacts to evaluate compliance.”

Why Option B is Correct:

Examine = analyzing artifacts.

Interview = discussions with personnel.

Test = executing technical checks.

Behavior is not an assessment method.

Question #:2 - [CMMC Ecosystem] SC.L2-3 13.14: Control and monitor the use of VoIP technologies is marked as NOT APPLICABLE for an OSC's assessment. How does this affect the assessment scope?

A. Any existing telephone system is in scope even if it is not using VoIP technology.

B. An error has been made and the Lead Assessor should be contacted to correct the error.

C. VoIP technology is within scope, and it uses FlPS-validated encryption, so it does not need to be assessed.

D. VoIP technology is not used within scope boundary, so no assessment procedures are specified for this practice.

Answer: D

Explanation

TheCMMC 2.0 Level 2requirementSC.L2-3.13.14comes fromNIST SP 800-171, Security Requirement 3.13.14, which mandates that organizations mustcontrol and monitor the use of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technologiesif used within their system boundary.

If a systemdoes not use VoIP technology, then this control isNot Applicable (N/A)because there is nothing to assess.

When a requirement is marked as Not Applicable (N/A), it means the OSC does not use the technology or process covered by that controlwithin its assessment boundary.

No assessment procedures are neededsince there is no VoIP system to evaluate.

Option A (Existing telephone system in scope)is incorrect becausetraditional (non-VoIP) telephone systems are not covered by SC.L2-3.13.14—only VoIP is within scope.

Option B (Error, contact the Lead Assessor)is incorrect because markingSC.L2-3.13.14 as N/A is valid if VoIP is not used. This is not an error.

Option C (VoIP in scope but using FIPS-validated encryption, so it doesn’t need to be assessed)is incorrect becauseeven if VoIP uses FIPS-validated encryption, the control would still need to be assessed to ensure monitoring and usage control are in place.

Question #:3 - [Implementation and Scoping] For the purpose of determining scope, what needs to be included as part of the assessment but would NOT receive a CMMC certification unless an enterprise assessment is conducted?

A. ESP

B. People

C. Test equipment

D. Government property Answer: A

Explanation

Per the CMMC Scoping Guidance, External Service Providers (ESPs) must be included in scope if they process, store, or transmit CUI or FCI on behalf of the OSC. However, ESPs do not themselves receive a separate CMMC certification unless they undergo their own assessment or an enterprise-level certification is conducted. Their environment is assessed only as part of the OSC’s scope.

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Theprimary goal of CMMC assessment proceduresis to determine whether anOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC)complies with the cybersecurity controls required for its certification level. Themost common purpose of assessment procedures is to obtain evidencethat verifies an organization has properly implemented security practices.

CMMC Assessments Require Evidence Collection TheCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guideoutlines that assessors must use three methods to verify compliance:

Examine– Reviewing documentation, policies, and system configurations.

Interview– Speaking with personnel to confirm understanding and execution.

Test– Validating controls through operational or technical tests.

All these methods involve obtaining evidenceto support whether a security requirement has been met. Alignment with NIST SP 800-171A CMMC Level 2 assessments follow NIST SP 800-171A, which is designed for evidence-based verification. Assessors rely on documented artifacts, system logs, configurations, and personnel testimony as evidence of compliance.

B. Define level of effort (Incorrect)

Thelevel of effortrefers to the time and resources needed for an assessment, but this is aplanningactivity, not the primary goal of an assessment.

C. Determine information flow (Incorrect)

While understandinginformation flowis important for security controls likedata protection and access control, themain purpose of an assessment is to gather evidence—not to determine information flow itself.

D. Determine value of hardware and software (Incorrect)

Asset valuation may be part of an organization’s risk management process, but CMMC assessmentsdo not focus on determining hardware or software value.

The correct answer isA. Obtain evidence, as theCMMC assessment process is evidence-drivento verify compliance with security controls.

Question #:5 - [CMMC Ecosystem] When assessing SI.L1-3.14.2: Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems, evidence shows that all of the OSC's workstations and servers have antivirus software installed for malicious code protection. A centralized console for the antivirus software management is in place and records show that all devices have received the most updated antivirus patterns. What is the BEST determination that the Lead Assessor should reach regarding the evidence?

A. It is sufficient, and the audit finding can be rated as MET.

B. It is insufficient, and the audit finding can be rated NOT MET.

C. It is sufficient, and the Lead Assessor should seek more evidence.

D. It is insufficient, and the Lead Assessor should seek more evidence. Answer: A

Explanation

Understanding SI.L1-3.14.2: Provide Protection from Malicious CodeThe CMMC Level 1 practiceSI.L13.14.2is based onNIST SP 800-171 Requirement 3.14.2, which requires organizations to:

Implement malicious code protection(e.g., antivirus, endpoint security software).

Ensure coverage across all appropriate locations(e.g., workstations, servers, network entry points).

Keep protection mechanisms updated(e.g., regular signature updates, policy enforcement).

Assessment Criteria for a "MET" Rating:To determine whether the practice isMET, the Lead Assessor must confirm that:

#Antivirus or endpoint protection software is installedon all workstations and servers.

#The solution is centrally managed, ensuring consistent policy enforcement.

#Signature updates are current, meaning systems are protected against new threats.

#Logs or reports demonstrate active monitoring and updates.

Why is the Correct Answer "A. It is sufficient, and the audit finding can be rated as MET"?The provided evidenceconfirms all necessary requirementsfor SI.L1-3.14.2:

#All workstations and servers have antivirus installed#Meets installation requirement.

#A centralized management console is in place#Ensures consistent enforcement.

#Records show antivirus signatures are up to date#Confirms system protection is current.

Because the evidencemeets the requirement, the practice should berated as MET.

D. It is insufficient, and the Lead Assessor should seek more evidence # Incorrect The evidence providedmeets the control requirements, making itsufficient.

Why Are the Other Answers Incorrect?

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Document Specifies that a practice can be marked asMET if sufficient evidence is provided.

NIST SP 800-171 (Requirement 3.14.2) Defines the standard formalicious code protection, which ismet by antivirus with active updates.

Question #:6 - [Implementation and Scoping]

An OSC performing a CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment uses a legacy Windows 95 computer, which is the only system that can run software that the government contract requires. Why can this asset be considered out of scope?

A. It handles CUI

B. It is a restricted IS

C. It is government property

D. It is operational technology Answer: B

Explanation

Leaders in it certification

6 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

A Restricted Information System (IS) is defined as an asset that cannot meet modern security controls but is still needed for contract performance. These systems may be declared out of scope if they are properly isolated, mitigated, and documented. A legacy Windows 95 computer meets the definition of a restricted IS. Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CMMC Scoping Guide (Level 2): “Restricted IS assets are those that cannot reasonably apply security requirements due to legacy or operational constraints. They are not assessed but must be identified and protected by alternative methods.”

Why Option B is Correct:

The Windows 95 system is an example of a restricted IS, so it can be scoped out.

Option A is incorrect — the asset is not handling CUI in this case.

Option C is incorrect — government property designation does not define scope.

Option D is incorrect — while it is “legacy,” it is not classified as OT; the correct CMMC term is restricted IS.

Question #:7 - [Roles and Responsibilities]

When executing a remediation review, the Lead Assessor should:

A. help OSC to complete planned remediation activities.

B. plan two consecutive remediation reviews for an OSC.

C. submit a delta assessment remediation package for C3PAO's internal quality review.

D. validate that practices previously listed on the POA&M have been removed on an updated Risk Assessment.

Answer: C

Explanation

In the context of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, the remediation review process is a critical phase where identified deficiencies from an initial assessment are addressed. The Lead Assessor, representing a Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO), plays a pivotal role in this process.

Role of the Lead Assessor in Remediation Reviews:

Leaders in it certification

7 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Validation of Remediation Efforts:

Objective:Ensure that the Organization Seeking Certification (OSC) has effectively addressed and corrected all deficiencies identified during the initial assessment.

Process:The Lead Assessor reviews the evidence provided by the OSC to confirm that each previously unmet practice now meets the required standards. This involves examining updated policies, procedures, system configurations, and other relevant artifacts.

Delta Assessment Remediation Package Submission:

Definition:A delta assessment focuses on evaluating only the components or practices that were previously found non-compliant or deficient.

Responsibility:After validating the remediation efforts, the Lead Assessor compiles a remediation package that includes:

Detailed documentation of the deficiencies identified in the initial assessment.

Evidence of the corrective actions taken by the OSC.

Findings from the reassessment of the remediated practices.

Internal Quality Review:This remediation package is then submitted for the C3PAO's internal quality review process. The purpose of this review is to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the assessment findings before finalizing the certification decision.

Rationale for Selecting Answer C:

Alignment with CMMC Assessment Process:The submission of a delta assessment remediation package for internal quality review is a standard procedure outlined in the CMMC Assessment Process. This step ensures that all remediated items are thoroughly evaluated and validated, maintaining the integrity of the certification process.

Clarification of Incorrect Options:

Option A:"Help OSC to complete planned remediation activities."

The Lead Assessor's role is to assess and validate the OSC's compliance, not to assist in the implementation or completion of remediation activities. Providing such assistance could lead to a conflict of interest and compromise the objectivity of the assessment.

Option B:"Plan two consecutive remediation reviews for an OSC."

The standard process involves conducting a single remediation review after the OSC has addressed the identified deficiencies. Planning multiple consecutive remediation reviews is not a typical practice and could indicate a lack of proper remediation planning by the OSC.

Option D:"Validate that practices previously listed on the POA&M have been removed on an updated Risk Assessment."

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

D. The OSC is not eligible for an option to remediate after the assessment is canceled.

Answer: C

Explanation

In the context of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, achieving Level 2 compliance requires an Organization Seeking Certification (OSC) to implement all 110 security practices outlined in NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2. The CMMC framework allows for a limited use of Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) to address certain deficiencies; however, this is contingent upon meeting specific criteria.

According to the final CMMC rule, to obtain a Conditional Level 2 status, an OSC must achieve a minimum score of 88 out of 110 points during the assessment. This scoring system assigns weighted values to each of the 110 security requirements, with some controls deemed critical and others non-critical. The POA&M mechanism permits OSCs to temporarily address non-critical deficiencies, provided the minimum score threshold is met. Critical controls, however, must be fully implemented at the time of assessment; they cannot be deferred and included in a POA&M.

MWE

In the scenario where 15 practices are NOT MET, the OSC's score would fall below the required 88-point threshold, rendering the organization ineligible for Conditional Level 2 status. Consequently, the OSC would not have the option to remediate these deficiencies through a POA&M. Instead, the organization must fully implement and rectify all NOT MET practices before undergoing a subsequent assessment to achieve the necessary compliance level.

This policy ensures that organizations handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) have adequately addressed all critical and non-critical security requirements, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of sensitive information within the Defense Industrial Base.

For detailed guidance on assessment criteria and the use of POA&Ms, refer to the CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 2 and the official CMMC documentation provided by the Department of Defense.

Explanation

Understanding Training Requirements in CMMCThe requirement for ensuring thatpersonnel are trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilitiesfirst appears inCMMC Level 2as part ofNIST SP 800-171 control AT.L2-3.2.1.

Key Details on the Training Requirement:#AT.L2-3.2.1: "Ensure that personnel are trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities."

#This control is derived fromNIST SP 800-171and applies toCMMC Level 2 (Advanced).

#It ensures that employees handlingControlled Unclassified Information (CUI)understand theircybersecurity responsibilities.

A. Level 1 # Incorrect

CMMC Level 1 does not include this training requirement.Level 1 focuses on basic safeguarding ofFederal Contract Information (FCI)but doesnot require formal cybersecurity training.

B. Level 2 # Correct

The training requirement (AT.L2-3.2.1) first appears in CMMC Level 2, which aligns withNIST SP 800-171.

C. Level 3 # Incorrect

The training requirementalready exists in Level 2. Level 3 builds on Level 2 with additionalrisk management and advanced cybersecurity controls, but training is introduced at Level 2.

D. All levels # Incorrect

CMMC Level 1 does not include this requirement—it is first introduced in Level 2.

Why is the Correct Answer "B. Level 2"?

Interview responses(e.g., verbal confirmation from personnel about their responsibilities). Demonstrations(e.g., showing how a security control is implemented in real time).

Testing(e.g., verifying technical security mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication). Thegoalof evidence collection is to determinewhether a CMMC practice is met—not just whether the organization operates within the assessment scope.

A. Verify, based on an assessment and organizational scope # Incorrect

Theassessment scopedefineswhat is evaluated, but adequacy of evidence is based oncompliance with specific CMMC practices.

B. Verify, based on an assessment and organizational practice # Incorrect

CMMC assessments focus on cybersecurity practices defined in the CMMC framework, not just general organizational practices.

C. Determine if a given artifact, interview response, demonstration, or test meets the CMMC scope # Incorrect Thescopedefines the assessment boundaries, but theassessment team's job is to confirm whether CMMC practices are satisfied.

D. Determine if a given artifact, interview response, demonstration, or test meets the CMMC practice # Correct TheCMMC assessment process focuses on ensuring that required practices are implemented, making this the correct answer.

Why is the Correct Answer "Determine if a given artifact, interview response, demonstration, or test meets the CMMC practice" (D)?

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Document Defines "adequate evidence" asproof that a CMMC practice has been correctly implemented.

CMMC 2.0 Assessment Criteria Specifies that evidence must beevaluated against specific cybersecurity practices.

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

UnderCMMC 2.0 Level 2, which aligns with the requirements ofNIST SP 800-171, maintaining robust control overnonlocal maintenance sessionsis critical. While multifactor authentication (MFA) is a required safeguard for secure access, additional measures must be implemented to fully meet the maintenance requirements as outlined inControl 3.3.5:

Key Requirements for Nonlocal Maintenance:

Termination of Nonlocal Maintenance Sessions:

To reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access, nonlocal maintenance connectionsmust be terminated immediately after the maintenance activity is completed. This is a direct requirement to mitigate risks associated with lingering remote sessions that could be exploited by threat actors.

Supporting Reference:NIST SP 800-171, Control 3.3.5 states: "Ensure that remote maintenance is conducted in a controlled manner and disable connections immediately after use."

Multifactor Authentication (MFA):

OSCs are required to implement MFA for nonlocal remote maintenance sessions. MFA must includeat least two factors(e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).

While the OSC’s use of MFA satisfies part of the requirement, it does not complete the control unless proper termination procedures are in place.

Policy and Procedure Adherence:

The OSC must also document amaintenance policyand ensure it reflects the need for terminating connections post-maintenance. The policy should outline roles, responsibilities, and steps for ensuring secure nonlocal maintenance practices.

Incorrect Options:

B. Unlimited connections:Allowing unrestricted nonlocal maintenance sessions is a significant security risk and violates the principle of least privilege.

C. Removing restrictions:Removing restrictions for convenience directly undermines compliance and security.

D. Multifactor authentication details:While MFA is necessary, the question states the OSC already uses it. Termination of sessions is the missing requirement.

Conclusion:

The requirement toterminate nonlocal maintenance sessions after maintenance is complete(Option A) is critical for compliance withCMMC 2.0 Level 2andNIST SP 800-171, Control 3.3.5. This ensures that nonlocal maintenance activities are secured against unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities.

A contractor provides services and data to the DoD. The transactions that occur to handle FCI take place over the contractor's business network, but the work is performed on contractor-owned systems, which must be configured based on government requirements and are used to support a contract. What type of Specialized Asset are these systems?

A. loT

B. Restricted IS

C. Test equipment

D. Government property Answer: B

Explanation

Understanding Restricted Information Systems (IS) in CMMC ScopingInCMMC 2.0,Specialized Assetsrefer to assets that do not fit traditional IT system categories but still play a role inprocessing, storing, or transmitting Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The four categories ofSpecialized Assetsin theCMMC Scoping Guideinclude:

Internet of Things (IoT) Devices– Smart or network-connected devices.

Restricted Information Systems (Restricted IS)– Systems that arecontractually requiredto beconfigured to government specifications.

Test Equipment– Devices used for specialized testing or measurement.

Government Property– Equipment owned by theU.S. Governmentbut used by contractors.

The contractor-owned systems in question areconfigured based on government requirementsandused to support a DoD contract.

Restricted ISassets arecontractually requiredto meet government security requirements andhandle DoDrelated information.

These systemsdo not fall under general IT assets but instead require special handling, making them a Restricted ISper theCMMC Scoping Guide.

A. IoT (Incorrect)

IoT devices includesmart devices, sensors, and embedded systems, but the contractor's business systems are not classified as IoT.

C. Test Equipment (Incorrect)

The contractor’s systems areused for handling FCI, not for testing or measurement.

A. OSC

B. C3PAO

C. C3PAO and OSC

D. OSC and Lead Assessor Answer: B

Explanation

The CAP specifies that the C3PAO is responsible for assigning the Lead Assessor to an OSC’s assessment. While the OSC contracts with the C3PAO, the authority to appoint the Lead Assessor resides solely with the C3PAO.

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CAP v2.0, Assessment Team Composition (§2.10): “The C3PAO shall designate a qualified Lead

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

D. Let team members know the questions prior to the assessment. Answer: C

Explanation

During aCMMC assessment, assessors rely on interviews to validate the implementation of cybersecurity practices within anOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC). Ensuringconfidentiality and nonattributionallows employees to speak freely without fear of retaliation or bias, leading to more accurate and candid responses.

CMMC Assessment Process and the Role of Interviews TheCMMC Assessment Guide(Level 2) states thatinterviews are a key methodto verify compliance with security controls.

Employees may hesitate to provide truthful information if they fear negative consequences.

To obtain accurate information, assessors must create an environment where team members feel safe. Ensuring Non-Attribution for Accurate Responses DoD Assessment Methodologyhighlights thatinterviewees should remain anonymousin reports. Non-attribution reduces the risk of OSC leadership influencing responses or retaliating against employees. Employees are more likely to provideaccurateandhonestdescriptions of their responsibilities when confidentiality is guaranteed.

Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) Interview groups of people to get collective answers:

Group interviews may limit honest responses due topeer pressure or management presence. Employees mayhesitate to contradictsupervisors or peers in a group setting.

(B) Understand that testing is more important than interviews:

While testing (e.g., reviewing logs, configurations, and security settings) is crucial, interviews providecontexton how security practices are implemented and followed. Interviewscomplementtesting rather than being less important.

(D) Let team members know the questions prior to the assessment:

Advanced notice may allow employees toprepare rehearsed answers, which might not reflect actual practices. This couldreduce the effectivenessof the interview process.

Question #:23 - [Governance and Source Documents] Companies that knowingly defraud the government by not being in compliance with cybersecurity regulations are at risk of being held liable for:

A. The contract value plus a penalty as stated in the Cyber Claims Act

B. The contract value plus a penalty as stated in the False Claims Act

C. Three times the contract value plus a penalty as stated in the Cyber Claims Act

D. Three times the contract value plus a penalty as stated in the False Claims Act Answer: D

Explanation

The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733) imposes liability on companies that knowingly misrepresent compliance in order to receive or retain federal contracts. Penalties include treble damages (three times the government’s losses) plus additional penalties per claim.

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

False Claims Act: “Any person who knowingly submits false claims to the Government is liable for three times the Government’s damages plus a penalty.”

DOJ Cyber-Fraud Initiative (2021): confirms the FCA is applied to cases of misrepresenting compliance with cybersecurity requirements.

Why Option D is Correct:

The applicable law is the False Claims Act, not a “Cyber Claims Act” (which does not exist).

The FCA specifies treble damages plus penalties, which exactly matches Option D.

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

B. In-scope Asset

C. Specialized Asset

D. Contractor Risk Managed Asset Answer: C

Explanation

This question deals withasset categorizationduring aCMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment. The organization is manufacturingspecialized partsfor the DoD, butLevel 1of CMMC only concernsFederal Contract Information (FCI)—notControlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Therefore, asset categorization should follow theCMMC Scoping Guidance for Level 1.

#Step 1: Understand CMMC Level 1 and FCI Level 1 Objective:

Implement basic safeguarding requirements as perFAR 52.204-21.

Applies to systems thatstore, process, or transmit FCI.

Self-assessments are permitted and required annually.

Source Reference:

CMMC Scoping Guidance – Level 1 (v1.0) https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC #Step 2: What is an “In-scope Asset”?

CMMC Scoping Guidance – Level 1definesIn-scope assetsas:

“Assets that process, store, or transmit FCI or provide security protection for such assets.”

In this scenario:

The machining company isperforming contract work(manufacturing DoD parts).

Thetesting is done internally, implying the systems and equipment used in testing and documentation aredirectly supporting the contract.

These systems likely handleFCIsuch as technical specifications, purchase orders, or test reports. ##Therefore, the equipment and systems used in testing are consideredIn-scope Assetsunder Level 1.

#Why the Other Options Are Incorrect A. CUI Asset

Leaders in it certification

29 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

#Incorrect forLevel 1:

CUI is only in scope atCMMC Level 2 and Level 3. Level 1 is concerned withFCI, not CUI.

C. Specialized Asset #Incorrect definition:

Specialized assets(defined inCMMC Level 2 Scoping) include IoT, OT, ICS, GFE, and similar types of nonenterprise assets that may require alternative treatment.

This classification isnot used in Level 1 Scoping.

D. Contractor Risk Managed Asset #Incorrect:

Also defined underCMMC Level 2 Scopingonly.

These are assets that are not security-protected but are managed via risk-based decisions.

This term isnot applicableforCMMC Level 1 assessments.

#Step 3: Alignment with Official Documentation According to theCMMC Scoping Guidance for Level 1:

“The assets within the self-assessment scope are those that process, store, or transmit FCI. These assets are considered ‘in-scope.’”

No other asset categorization (such as CUI asset, specialized asset, or contractor risk managed asset) is used atLevel 1.

BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):

For aCMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment, theonlyasset category officially recognized is theIn-scope Asset— any asset that handles or protects FCI. Since the company's internal testing operations are part of fulfilling the DoD contract, the systems and staff involved arein scope.

#2. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) Gathering Evidence#

Evidence collection is part of the assessment butnot the primary topic of the opening briefing.

(B) Review of the OSC's SSP#

While theSSP is a key document, reviewing it is part of the assessment,not the kickoff briefing.

(D) Examination of the artifacts for sufficiency#

Artifact review happens laterin the assessment process,not during the kickoff.

D. "The CMMC C3PAO determines the CMMC Assessment Scope, and the Lead Assessor validates the CMMC Assessment Scope."

Answer: B

Explanation

In aCMMC Level 2 assessment, theOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC)is responsible for identifying theassessment scopebased on theCMMC Scoping Guidanceprovided by theCyber AB (Cyber Accreditation Body) and DoD.

The OSC must determine which assets and systems handleControlled Unclassified Information (CUI)and categorize them accordingly.

Reference:

Step 2: Role of the C3PAO in Scope ValidationOnce the OSC has determined itsCMMC assessment scope, aCMMC Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO)is responsible forvalidatingthe scope during theassessment planning phase.

TheC3PAO reviewsthe OSC’s scope to ensure it aligns withDoD’s scoping guidance, ensuring that all relevant assets, networks, and policies required forCMMC Level 2 certificationare correctly identified.

If there are discrepancies, the C3PAO works with the OSC to adjust the scope before proceeding with the assessment.

Question #:29 - [CMMC Ecosystem] The Lead Assessor interviews a network security specialist of an OSC. The incident monitoring report for the month shows that no security incidents were reported from OSC's external SOC service provider. This is provided as evidence for RA.L2-3.11.2: Scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting those systems and applications are identified. Based on this information, the Lead Assessor should conclude that the evidence is:

A. inadequate because it is irrelevant to the practice.

B. adequate because it fits well for expected artifacts.

C. adequate because no security incidents were reported.

D. inadequate because the OSC's service provider should be interviewed. Answer: A

Explanation

Understanding RA.L2-3.11.2: Vulnerability ScanningTheRA.L2-3.11.2practice requires organizations to: #Regularly scan for vulnerabilitiesin systems and applications.

#Perform scans when new vulnerabilities are identified.

#Use vulnerability scanning tools or servicesto proactively detect security weaknesses.

Anincident monitoring reporttrackssecurity incidents, notvulnerability scanning activities.

Vulnerability scanning reportsshould include:#A list of vulnerabilities detected.#Remediation actions taken. #Scan frequency and schedule.

Theabsence of reported security incidentsdoesnotconfirm that vulnerability scans were performed.

Question #:31 - [Implementation and Scoping] A server is used to store FCI with a cloud provider long-term. What is the server considered?

A. In scope, because the cloud provider will be storing the FCI data

B. Out of scope, because the cloud provider stores the FCI data long-term

C. In scope, because the cloud provider is required to be CMMC Level 2 certified

D. Out of scope, because encryption is always used when the cloud provider stores the FCI data Answer: A

Explanation

Assets that store, process, or transmit FCI or CUI are always in scope for CMMC. If a server with a cloud provider is used for long-term storage of FCI, that server is considered in scope because it directly holds covered data.

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CMMC Scoping Guide for Level 1: “Assets that store, process, or transmit FCI are in scope.” CMMC Scoping Guide for Level 2: confirms the same rule applies for CUI.

Why Option A is Correct:

The server stores FCI, making it automatically in scope.

Option B is incorrect because long-term storage does not make an asset out of scope.

Option C is incorrect — Level 1 (FCI) does not require a Level 2 certified provider.

Option D is incorrect because encryption does not remove scope requirements.

Which Assessment Method does this activity fall under?

A. Test

B. Observe

C. Examine

D. Interview Answer: C

Explanation

Understanding Assessment Methods in CMMC 2.0According to theCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide, assessors usethree primary assessment methodsto determine compliance with security practices: Examine– Reviewing documents, policies, configurations, and system records.

Interview– Speaking with personnel to gather insights into security processes.

Test– Performing technical validation of system functions and security controls.

TheAssessment Team Memberis inspectingAssessment Objects(e.g., system configurations, user access control settings, policies) to determine if the OSC's evidence is sufficient forAC.L1-3.1.1 (Access Control Authorized Users).

This activity aligns directly with theExaminemethod, which involves reviewing artifacts such as:

Access control lists (ACLs) System user authentication logs Account management policies Role-based access control settings "Observe" (Option B)is incorrect because "observing" is not an official assessment method in CMMC.

D. Inform the OSC and the C3PAO of the possible conflict of interest, document the conflict and mitigation actions in the assessment plan, and if the mitigation actions are acceptable, continue with the assessment.

Answer: D

Explanation

TheCybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Assessment Process (CAP)outlines strict guidelines regardingconflicts of interest (COI)to ensure the integrity and impartiality of assessments conducted byCertified Third-Party Assessment Organizations (C3PAOs)andCertified Assessors (CAs).

The scenario presented involves apotential conflict of interestdue to a prior relationship (former college roommate) between thecertified assessorand an individual at theOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC). While this prior relationship does not automatically disqualify the assessor, it must bedisclosed, documented, and mitigated appropriately.

Inform the OSC and C3PAO of the Potential Conflict of Interest TheCMMC Code of Professional Conduct (CoPC)requires assessors to disclose any potential conflicts of interest.

Transparency ensures that all parties, including theOSC and C3PAO, are aware of the situation.

Document the Conflict and Mitigation Actions in the Assessment Plan PerCMMC CAP documentation, potential conflicts should be assessed based on their material impact on the objectivity of the assessment.

The conflict and proposed mitigation strategies must beformally recorded in the assessment planto provide an audit trail.

Determine If the Mitigation Actions Are Acceptable If theOSC and C3PAOdetermine that the mitigation actions adequatelyeliminate or reduce the risk of bias, the assessment may proceed.

Common mitigation strategies include:

Assigning another assessor forinterviews with the conflicted individual.

Ensuring thatdecisions regarding the OSC’s compliance are reviewed independently.

Proceed with the Assessment If Mitigation Is Acceptable If the mitigation actions sufficiently address the conflict, the assessment may continue understrict adherence to documented procedures.

A. Do not inform the OSC and the C3PAO of the possible conflict of interest, and continue as planned. #Incorrect. This violates CMMC’s integrity requirements and could result indisciplinary actions against the assessor or invalidation of the assessment. Transparency is mandatory.

B. Inform the OSC and the C3PAO of the possible conflict of interest, and start the entire process over

without the conflicted team member.#Incorrect. The CAP doesnotmandate immediate reassignment unless the conflict isunresolvable. Instead, mitigation strategies should be considered first.

C. Inform the OSC and the C3PAO of the possible conflict of interest but since it has been an acceptable amount of time since college, no conflict of interest exists, and continue as planned.#Incorrect.The passage of time alone does not automatically eliminate a conflict of interest. Proper documentation and mitigation are still required.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Document– Defines COI requirements and mitigation actions.

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

In the context of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Assessment Process, understanding the roles of various entities associated with an Organization Seeking Certification (OSC) is crucial during the planning phase. When a Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO) staff reviews these entities for a CMMC Level 2 Assessment, it's essential to distinguish between internal components and external participants.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Definition of the HQ Organization:

The HQ Organization refers to the entire legal entity delivering services under the terms of a Department of Defense (DoD) contract. This entity is responsible for ensuring compliance with CMMC requirements.

Identification of External Entities:

External entities encompass people, processes, and technology that are not part of the HQ Organization but support its operations. These entities participate in the assessment process due to their involvement in handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or Federal Contract Information (FCI) related to the DoD contract.

Role of Supporting Organizations/Units:

According to the CMMC Assessment Process documentation, Supporting Organizations are defined as "the people, procedures, and technology external to the HQ Organization that support the Host Unit." These external entities are integral to the operations of the Host Unit but are not encompassed within the HQ Organization's immediate structure.

Assessment Implications:

While Supporting Organizations/Units play a vital role in supporting the Host Unit, they do not receive a separate CMMC Level certification unless an enterprise assessment is conducted. In such cases, the assessment would encompass both the HQ Organization and its Supporting Organizations to ensure comprehensive compliance across all associated entities.

References:

CMMC Assessment Process documentation defines Supporting Organizations as external entities that support the Host Unit.

Cyberab

By accurately identifying and understanding the role of Supporting Organizations/Units, the C3PAO ensures that all relevant entities are considered during the assessment planning phase, thereby maintaining the integrity and comprehensiveness of the CMMC Level 2 Assessment.

Question #:40 - [CMMC Ecosystem]

Regarding the Risk Assessment (RA) domain, what should an OSC periodically assess?

A. Organizational operations, business assets, and employees

Leaders in it certification

47 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

B. Organizational operations, business processes, and employees

C. Organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals

D. Organizational operations, organizational processes, and individuals Answer: C

Explanation

TheRisk Assessment (RA) domainaligns withNIST SP 800-171 control family 3.11 (Risk Assessment)and is designed to help organizationsidentify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risksthat could impact their operations.

TheRA.3.144 practice(which is a CMMC Level 2 requirement) explicitly states:

"Periodically assess therisktoorganizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individualsresulting from the operation of organizational systems and the associated processing, storage, or transmission of CUI."

This means that OSCs (Organizations Seeking Certification) should regularly evaluate risks to: #Organizational operations(e.g., mission, business continuity, functions) #Organizational assets(e.g., data, IT systems, intellectual property) #Individuals(e.g., employees, contractors, customers affected by security risks) Thus, the correct answer isC. Organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.

A. Organizational operations, business assets, and employees#Incorrect."Business assets"is not the correct terminology used in CMMC/NIST SP 800-171. Instead,"organizational assets"is the proper term.

B. Organizational operations, business processes, and employees#Incorrect."Business processes"is not a part of the formal risk assessment requirement. The correct scope includesorganizational assetsandindividuals, not just processes.

D. Organizational operations, organizational processes, and individuals#Incorrect. While processes are important,organizational assetsmust be considered in the assessment, not just processes.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect CMMC 2.0 Model (Level 2 - RA.3.144)– Specifies that risk assessments must coverorganizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.

NIST SP 800-171 (3.11.1)– Reinforces the same risk assessment scope.

CMMC Official ReferencesThus,option C (Organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals) is the correct answerbased on official CMMC risk assessment requirements.

Question #:41 - [CMMC Ecosystem] An OSC has submitted evidence for an upcoming assessment. The assessor reviews the evidence and determines it is not adequate or sufficient to meet the CMMC practice. What can the assessor do?

A. Notify the CMMC-AB.

B. Cancel the assessment.

C. Postpone the assessment.

D. Contact the C3PAO for guidance. Answer: D

Explanation

Step 1: Understand the Assessor’s Role and Chain of ResponsibilityDuring a CMMC assessment, the assessor ispart of the team organized by a C3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization). If the assessor determines thatevidence is insufficient or inadequate, they arenot authorizedto act independently in terms of halting or postponing the assessment.

Source Reference: CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) v1.0 – Section 3.5.4 & 3.5.6 "If the Assessment Team identifies gaps in the sufficiency or adequacy of evidence, they must work with the Lead Assessor and C3PAO to determine the appropriate course of action."

The C3PAO is responsible for overseeing the assessment lifecycle.

If evidence isnot adequate, the assessor mustescalate within their organization(i.e., to the Lead Assessor or C3PAO point of contact) to:

Request clarifications from the OSC, Determine if additional evidence can be requested, Decide on continuing, pausing, or modifying the assessment schedule.

#Step 2: Why Contacting the C3PAO Is the Correct Action

A. Notify the CMMC-AB# Incorrect. The Cyber AB (formerly CMMC-AB) isnot involved in operational aspectsof assessments. They do not manage day-to-day assessment decisions.

B. Cancel the assessment# Incorrect. An assessorcannot unilaterally cancelan assessment. Only theC3PAO, in consultation with all parties, may take such action.

C. Postpone the assessment# Incorrect. Postponements are logistical decisions that must be managed through theC3PAO, not an individual assessor.

Question #:42 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] A Lead Assessor is preparing to conduct a Readiness Review during Phase 1 of the Assessment Process. How much evidence MUST be gathered for each practice?

A. A sufficient amount

B. At least 2 Assessment Objects

C. Evidence that is deemed adequate

D. Evidence to support at least 2 Assessment Methods Answer: A

Explanation

During a Readiness Review (Phase 1), the purpose is to validate whether an OSC is prepared to move forward with a formal assessment. The CAP specifies that the Lead Assessor must collect sufficient evidence for each practice to make a preliminary determination of readiness.

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CAP v2.0, Readiness Review (§2.14): “The Lead Assessor must collect a sufficient amount of evidence

for each practice to determine the OSC’s readiness.” Why Option A is Correct:

The requirement is for sufficient evidence; CAP does not mandate a set number of assessment objects

or methods.

Options B, C, and D incorrectly suggest minimum counts or methods that are not part of the readiness

review requirements.

A. It allows the OSC to comment and provide additional evidence.

B. It determines whether the OSC will be rated MET or NOT MET on their assessment.

C. It confirms that the Assessment Team's findings are right and cannot be changed.

D. It corroborates the Assessment Team's understanding of the CMMC practices and controls. Answer: A

Explanation

1. Understanding the Validation of Findings in CMMC AssessmentsValidation of findings is an essential part of theCMMC assessment process, ensuring that observations and preliminary conclusions drawn by the assessment team are accurate, fair, and based on complete evidence. This process occurs iteratively during theDaily Checkpointsand is fundamental in determining the overall compliance status of theOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC).

2. The Role of Preliminary Findings in the Assessment ProcessPreliminary findings arenot finalbut rather a mechanism for ensuring transparency, accuracy, and fairness. These findings serve several key purposes: Allows for OSC Input & Clarification: The OSC has an opportunity to review andprovide additional evidencethat may address deficiencies identified by the assessment team.

Prevents Misinterpretations: By allowing the OSC to comment, the assessment team can refine or correct their understanding of the OSC's implementation of CMMC practices.

Supports Fair and Informed Ratings: Before finalizing MET or NOT MET determinations, the assessment team ensures they have considered all relevant evidence.

Encourages a Collaborative Assessment Process: This validation activity fosters open communication between assessors and the OSC, reducing disputes and misunderstandings.

The primary purpose of preliminary findings is to allow theOSC to comment and provide additional evidencebefore final determinations are made.

This aligns withCMMC Assessment Process guidance, which emphasizes iterative validation of findings throughDaily Checkpoints and Final Outbriefdiscussions.

The validation of findings ensures thatOSC responses and supplementary evidence are considered, making the assessment process more accurate and fair.

3. Why Answer Choice "A" is Correct4. Why Other Answer Choices Are IncorrectOption Reason for Elimination

B. It determines whether the OSC will be rated MET or NOT MET on their assessment.

This ensures that compliance deficiencies are clearly identified, allowing the OSC to understand what must be corrected.

#2. How This Process Works in a CMMC Assessment Assessorsreview collected documentation, system configurations, policies, and interview responses.

They verify that the evidencematches the expected implementationof a practice.

If gaps exist, they arerecordedfor discussion and potential remediation before assessment completion.

#3. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) Map test and demonstration responses to CMMC practices.#

Incorrect:While mapping evidence to CMMC practices is part of the assessment, theprimary intentof the "Verify Evidence and Record Gaps" step is toidentify deficiencies, not just mapping responses.

(B) Conduct interviews to test process implementation knowledge.#

Incorrect:Interviews are a method used during evidence collection, but they arenot the primary focusof the verification and gap analysis step.

(C) Determine the one-to-one relationship between a practice and an assessment object.#

Incorrect:The assessment teamreviews multiple sources of evidencefor each practice, and some practices require multiple assessment objects. The goal isnot a strict one-to-one mappingbut rathera holistic validation of compliance.

Final Validation from CMMC Documentation:TheCMMC Assessment Process Guidestates that"Verify Evidence and Record Gaps"is the step where assessorscompare expected evidence against what has been provided and document discrepancies. This ensurestransparent assessment findings and remediation planning. Thus, the correct answer is:

D. Identify and describe differences between what the Assessment Team required and the evidence collected.

Leaders in it certification

63 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

The CMMC Level 2 assessment must align withNIST SP 800-171and follow the procedures outlined in theCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide v1.0, particularly aroundevidence collection and scoring methodology.

#Step 1: Refer to the CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide v1.0CAP v1.0 – Section 3.5.4: Evaluate Evidence and Score Practices“To assign a MET determination, the Assessment Team must collect and corroborate at least two types of objective evidence: either through examination of artifacts, interviews (affirmation), or testing (demonstration).”

This meansat least two typesof the following evidence are required:

Examine(documentation/artifacts), Interview(affirmation from personnel), Test(demonstration of implementation).

#Step 2: Clarify the Official Minimum Standard for a Practice to be Scored METThe CAP explicitly states: “A practice can only be scored MET when a minimum oftwo types of evidencefrom the E-I-T (Examine, Interview, Test) triad are successfully collected and evaluated.”

Theevidence types must come from two different categories, for example:

An artifact(Examine)+ an interview affirmation(Interview), A demonstration(Test)+ an interview(Interview), Etc.

This cross-validation ensures that the control isimplemented, documented, and understoodby personnel — a core principle in assessing effective cybersecurity implementation.

#Why the Other Options Are IncorrectA. All three types of evidence are documented for every control#Incorrect:While collecting all three types (E-I-T) strengthens the assessment, theminimum requirementis onlytwo. Collecting all three isnot requiredfor a practice to be scoredMET.

B. Examine and accept evidence from one of the three evidence types#Incorrect:This fails to meet

theminimum two-evidence-type requirementset by the CAP. Single-source evidence is not sufficient to score a practice as MET.

C. Complete one of the following; examine two artifacts, observe one demonstration, or receive one

affirmation#Incorrect:Even if two artifacts are examined,this is still only one type of evidence(Examine). The CAP requires twotypes— not two instances of the same type.

#Why D is CorrectD. Complete two of the following: examine one artifact, either observe a satisfactory demonstration of one control or receive one affirmation from the OSC personnel.

# This directly reflects theCAP’s requirement for collecting two different types of objective evidenceto determine a practice is MET.

BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):To score a CMMC Level 2 practice asMET, the Assessment Team must collecta minimum of two distinct types of evidence— from theExamine, Interview, Test (E-I-T)categories. This requirement is clearly stated in the CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) v1.0.

Question #:53 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] Which NIST SP defines the Assessment Procedure leveraged by the CMMC?

A. NIST SP 800-53

B. NISTSP800-53a

C. NIST SP 800-171

D. NISTSP800-171a Answer: D

Explanation

Which NIST SP Defines the Assessment Procedures for CMMC?CMMC Level 2 isdirectly based on NIST SP 800-171, and the assessment procedures used in CMMC assessments are derived fromNIST SP 800-171A. Step-by-Step Breakdown:#1. NIST SP 800-171A Defines Assessment Procedures NIST SP 800-171Ais titled"Assessing Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)". It providesdetailed assessment objectives and test proceduresfor evaluating compliance withNIST SP 800-171 security requirements, whichCMMC Level 2 is fully aligned with.

CMMC Assessors use 800-171Aas abaseline for assessing the effectiveness of security controls.

#2. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) NIST SP 800-53#

800-53 defines security controlsfor federal information systems, but it doesnot provide assessment procedures specific to CMMC.

(B) NIST SP 800-53A#

800-53A provides assessment procedures for 800-53 controls, butCMMC is based on NIST SP 800-171, not 800-53.

Question #:54 - [CMMC Ecosystem] Evidence gathered from an OSC is being reviewed. Based on the assessment and organizational scope, the Lead Assessor requests the Assessment Team to verify that the coverage by domain, practice. Host Unit. Supporting Organization/Unit, and enclaves are comprehensive enough to rate against each practice. Which criteria is the assessor referring to?

A. Adequacy

B. Capability

C. Sufficiency

D. Objectivity Answer: A

Explanation

Step 1: Understand the Definitions of Evidence Evaluation CriteriaTheCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) introduces two key criteria for evaluating evidence:

Adequacy– Does the evidencealign with the practice?

Sufficiency– Is the evidencecomprehensive enoughin terms ofcoverage across systems, users, and scope? CAP v1.0 – Section 3.5.4:

“Evidence must be evaluated for bothadequacy(is it the right evidence?) andsufficiency(is there enough of it across all in-scope assets and areas?) to score a practice as MET.”

Question #:56 - [CMMC Model Overview] According to the Configuration Management (CM) domain, which principle is the basis for defining essential system capabilities?

A. Least privilege

B. Essential concern

C. Least functionality

D. Separation of duties Answer: C

Explanation

Understanding the Principle of Least Functionality in the CM DomainTheConfiguration Management (CM) domainin CMMC 2.0 focuses on maintaining the security and integrity of an organization’s systems through controlled configurations and restrictions on system capabilities.

The principle ofLeast Functionalityrefers to limiting a system’s features, services, and applications to only those necessary for its intended purpose. This principle reduces the attack surface by minimizing unnecessary components that could be exploited by attackers.

CMMC Practice CM.L2-3.4.6 (Use Least Functionality)explicitly states:"Employ the principle of least functionality by configuring organizational systems to provide only essential capabilities."

A. FBI CUI Introduction to Marking

B. NARA CUI Introduction to Marking

C. C3PAO CUI Introduction to Marking

D. CMMC-AB CUI Introduction to Marking

Answer: B

Explanation

The Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program, established by Executive Order 13556, standardizes the handling and marking of unclassified information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls across federal agencies and their contractors. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) serves as the Executive Agent responsible for implementing the CUI Program.

In the context of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, particularly at Level 2, organizations are required to protect CUI by adhering to the security requirements outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-171. This includes proper marking of CUI to ensure that all personnel recognize and handle such information appropriately.

The NARA CUI Introduction to Marking provides comprehensive guidance on the correct procedures for marking documents and communications containing CUI. This resource is essential for training purposes, as it offers detailed instructions and examples to help personnel understand and implement proper CUI markings. By referring the sales team to the NARA CUI Introduction to Marking, the director of sales ensures that the team receives authoritative and standardized training on how to appropriately mark emails and other documents containing CUI, thereby maintaining compliance with federal regulations and CMMC requirements.

D. Processes, people, physical entities, and IT systems in which CUI processed, stored, or transmitted Answer: D

Explanation

Understanding RA.L2-3.11.1 Risk Assessment Scope in CMMC Level 2TheCMMC Level 2 control RA.L2-

3.11.1aligns withNIST SP 800-171, Requirement 3.11.1, which mandates that organizationsperiodically assess risks to operations, assets, and individuals arising from the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI. What is Required for Compliance?

The organization must performrisk assessments on all assets and entities involved in handling CUI.

Risk assessments mustevaluate potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts on CUI security.

The scopemust include people, processes, physical locations, and IT systemsto ensure comprehensive risk management.

Why the Correct Answer is "Processes, people, physical entities, and IT systems in which CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted":

CUIcan be exposed to risk in multiple ways—not just IT systems but also human error, physical security gaps, and process weaknesses.

Risk assessmentsmust evaluate all areas that could impact CUI security, including:

Personnel security risks(e.g., insider threats, phishing attacks).

Process vulnerabilities(e.g., mishandling of CUI, policy weaknesses).

Physical security risks(e.g., unauthorized access to servers, storage rooms).

IT systems(e.g., networks, servers, cloud environments processing CUI).

A. "IT systems"#Too narrow.Risk assessmentmust cover more than just IT systems, includingpeople, physical assets, and processesaffecting CUI.

B. "Enterprise systems"#Too broad.While enterprise systems might be assessed, thefocus is specifically on areas handling CUI, not all enterprise operations.

C. "CUI Marking processes"#Incorrect focus.While marking CUI correctly is important,RA.L2-3.11.1 pertains to risk assessments, not data classification.

Question #:61 - [CMMC Model Overview] Which document is the BEST source for determining the sources of evidence for a given practice?

A. NISTSP 800-53

B. NISTSP 800-53A

C. CMMC Assessment Scope

D. CMMC Assessment Guide Answer: D

Explanation

TheCMMC Assessment Guideis the best source for determining the sources of evidence for a given practice because it provides specific guidance on how organizations should implement and demonstrate compliance with CMMC practices. Each CMMC level has its own assessment guide (e.g.,CMMC Assessment Guide Level 1, Level 2), detailing expected evidence and assessment procedures.

CMMC Assessment Guide (Primary Source for Evidence) TheCMMC Assessment Guideexplicitly outlines the evidence required to verify compliance with each practice.

It provides detailed instructions on assessment objectives, clarifying what assessors should look for when determining compliance.

The guide breaks down each practice intoassessment objectives, helping organizations prepare appropriate documentation and artifacts.

Other Documents and Why They Are Not the Best Choice:

NIST SP 800-53 (Option A) WhileNIST SP 800-53provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls, it does not focus on CMMC-specific evidence requirements.

It serves as a foundational cybersecurity framework but does not define the specific artifacts required for CMMC assessment.

Question #:62 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] Which assessment method compares actual-specified conditions with expected behavior?

A. Test

B. Examine

C. Compile

D. Interview Answer: A

Explanation

Understanding CMMC Assessment MethodsTheCybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 follows theNIST SP 800-171A assessment methodology, which includesthree primary assessment methods: Examine– Reviewing policies, procedures, system configurations, and documentation.

Interview– Engaging with personnel to validate their understanding and execution of security practices.

Leaders in it certification

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Test– Conducting actual technical or operational tests to determine whether security controls function as expected.

"Test" is the method that compares actual-specified conditions with expected behavior.

It involvesexecuting procedures, configurations, or automated toolsto see if thesystem behaves as required. For example, if a policy states that multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enforced, a test would involveattempting to log in without MFAto confirm whether access is blocked as expected.

TheNIST SP 800-171A Guide (Assessment Procedures for CUI)defines testing as an assessment method that: Actively verifies a security control is functioning Simulates real-world attack scenarios Checks compliance through system actions rather than documentation

B. Examine (Incorrect)

Examining only involvesreviewing policies, procedures, or configurationsbut does not actively test system behavior.

C. Compile (Incorrect)

"Compile" is not an assessment method in CMMC 2.0 or NIST SP 800-171A.

D. Interview (Incorrect)

Interviews are used to gather insights from personnel, but they do not compare actual conditions with expected behavior.

The correct answer isA. Testbecause itactively verifies system performance against expected security conditions.

B. stored, processed, and transmitted.

C. entered, edited, manipulated, printed, and viewed.

D. located on electronic media, on system component memory, and on paper. Answer: B

Explanation

TheCMMC Scoping Guide for Level 2outlines thatCUI assetsinclude systems, applications, and services thatstore, process, or transmitControlled Unclassified Information (CUI). These are the three core functions that defineCUI handlingwithin anOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC).

Step-by-Step Breakdown:#1. CUI Assets Defined in CMMC Stored:CUI is saved on hard drives, cloud storage, or databases.

Processed:CUI is actively used, modified, or analyzed by applications and users.

Transmitted:CUI is sent between systems via email, file transfers, or network communication.

#2. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) Received and transferred#

Whilereceiving and transferring CUIis part of handling CUI, it does not fully cover all CUI asset responsibilities.

(C) Entered, edited, manipulated, printed, and viewed#

These arespecific actionswithinprocessingbut do not coverstorage or transmission, which are also required for CMMC scoping.

(D) Located on electronic media, on system component memory, and on paper#

While CUI can exist inelectronic and physical forms, CMMC scoping focuses onhow CUI is actively managed (stored, processed, transmitted)rather than where it physically resides.

TheCMMC Level 2 Scoping Guideconfirms thatCUI Assets are categorized based on their role in storing, processing, or transmitting CUI.

NIST SP 800-171also defines these three functions as key components of CUI protection.

A. Verify the readiness to conduct the assessment.

B. Perform certification assessment readiness review.

C. Update the assessment plan and schedule as needed

D. Obtain and record commitment to the assessment plan. Answer: A

Explanation

Last Step in Developing an Assessment Plan for an OSCDeveloping anassessment planinvolves: Defining the assessment scope(e.g., systems, networks, locations).

Planning test activities(e.g., interviews, evidence review, technical testing).

Verifying the OSC’s readiness(e.g., ensuring required documents are available).

Updating the assessment plan and schedule as needed.

Final Step: Obtaining and recording the OSC’s commitment to the assessment plan.

Why is obtaining commitment the last step?#Theassessment cannot proceed unless the OSC agrees to the finalized plan.

#This ensuresOSC leadership understands the scope, timeline, and responsibilities.

#TheC3PAO must document this commitmentto formalize the agreement.

A. Verify the readiness to conduct the assessment # Incorrect

Readiness verification happens earlierin the planning process, not as the last step.

B. Perform certification assessment readiness review # Incorrect

Areadiness review is conducted before finalizing the plan, not at the very end.

C. Update the assessment plan and schedule as needed # Incorrect

Updating the plan happens before commitment is obtained; it is not the final step.

D. Obtain and record commitment to the assessment plan # Correct

This is the final step before conducting the assessment. The OSC must formally agree to the plan. Why is the Correct Answer "D. Obtain and record commitment to the assessment plan"?

Question #:65 - [CMMC Ecosystem] During a Level 2 Assessment, the OSC has provided an inventory list of all hardware. The list includes servers, workstations, and network devices. Why should this evidence be sufficient for making a scoring determination for AC.L2-3.1.19: Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms?

A. The inventory list does not specify mobile devices.

B. The interviewee attested to encrypting all data at rest.

C. The inventory list does not include Bring Your Own Devices.

D. The DoD has accepted an alternative safeguarding measure for mobile devices. Answer: A

Explanation

In the context of a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Level 2 Assessment, specific practices must be evaluated to ensure compliance with established security requirements. One such practice is AC.L2-3.1.19, which mandates the encryption of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Requirement Overview:

Practice AC.L2-3.1.19 requires organizations to "Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms." This ensures that any CUI accessed, stored, or transmitted via mobile devices is protected through encryption, mitigating risks associated with data breaches or unauthorized access.

Assessment of Provided Evidence:

During the assessment, the Organization Seeking Certification (OSC) provided an inventory list encompassing servers, workstations, and network devices. Notably, this list lacks any mention of mobile devices or mobile computing platforms.

Leaders in it certification

79 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Implications of the Omission:

The absence of mobile devices in the inventory suggests that the OSC may not have accounted for all assets that process, store, or transmit CUI. Without a comprehensive inventory that includes mobile devices, it's challenging to verify whether the OSC has implemented the necessary encryption measures for CUI on these platforms.

Assessment Determination:

Given the incomplete inventory, the evidence is insufficient to make a definitive scoring determination for practice AC.L2-3.1.19. The OSC must provide a detailed inventory that encompasses all relevant devices, including mobile devices and computing platforms, to demonstrate compliance with the encryption requirements for CUI.

References:

CMMC Model Overview Version 2.13, which outlines the requirements for practice AC.L2-3.1.19. Ensuring a complete and accurate inventory is a critical step in the assessment process, as it forms the basis for evaluating the implementation of security controls across all relevant assets within the organization.

Question #:66 - [CMMC Model Overview] The IT manager is scoping the company's CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment. The manager considers which servers, laptops. databases, and applications are used to store, process, or transmit FCI. Which asset type is being considered by the IT manager?

Facilities (Physical locations housing FCI/CUI) Technology (Hardware, software, and networks that store, process, or transmit FCI/CUI) CUI Assets (For Level 2 assessments, assets specifically storing CUI) Why "Technology" Is the Correct AnswerThe IT manager is evaluatingservers, laptops, databases, and applications—all of which aretechnology assetsused to store, process, or transmit FCI.

According toCMMC Scoping Guidance,Technology assetsinclude:

#Endpoints(Laptops, Workstations, Mobile Devices) #Servers(On-premise or cloud-based) #Networking Devices(Routers, Firewalls, Switches) #Applications(Software, Cloud-based tools) #Databases(Storage of FCI or CUI) Since the IT manager is focusing on these components, the correct asset category isTechnology (Option D).

A. ESP (Security Protection Assets)#Incorrect. ESPs refer tosecurity-related assets(e.g., firewalls, monitoring tools, managed security services) thathelp protectFCI/CUI but do notstore, process, or transmitit directly.

B. People#Incorrect. While employees play a role in handling FCI, the question focuses onhardware and software—which falls underTechnology, not People.

C. Facilities#Incorrect. Facilities refer tophysical buildingsor secured areas where FCI/CUI is stored or

processed. The question explicitly mentionsservers, laptops, and applications, which arenot physical facilities. Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect CMMC Level 1 Scoping Guide (CMMC-AB)– Defines asset categories, including Technology.

C. DoD agency or client

D. Contractor organization Answer: D

Explanation

The prime contractor (contractor organization)is responsible for ensuring thatits subcontractorshave the requiredCMMC certification levelbefore engaging them inDoD contracts that involve FCI or CUI.

This requirement is enforced throughflow-down clausesinDFARS 252.204-7021, which mandates that subcontractors handlingCUImeet the necessaryCMMC Level 2 or Level 3 requirements.

Reference:

DFARS 252.204-7021(CMMC Compliance) CMMC 2.0 Program Documentation Step 2: Why Other Answer Choices Are IncorrectA. CMMC-AB (Incorrect):

TheCyber AB (formerly CMMC-AB)is responsible foraccrediting C3PAOs and managing the assessment process, but it does not enforce subcontractor compliance.

B. OUSDA&S (Incorrect):

TheOffice of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment (OUSD A&S)develops and overseesCMMC policy, but it does not monitor or enforce individual subcontractor compliance.

C. DoD agency or client (Incorrect):

While theDoD sets CMMC requirements, it relies onprime contractors to ensure compliance among their subcontractorsthrough contract flow-down requirements.

Final Confirmation of Correct Answer:Prime contractors must ensure their subcontractors have the required CMMC certification level to handle FCI or CUI.

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

D. Subjectivity criteria Answer: A

Explanation

In the context of CMMC 2.0 assessments, thesufficiency criteriaare used to determine whether the assessment team has gathered enough evidence to support their conclusions about compliance with a given requirement. Definition of Sufficiency Criteria:

Sufficiency refers to thequantityandcompletenessof the evidence collected during an assessment.

This ensures that the evidence collected isenough to support an objective and valid determinationof compliance.

Why Sufficiency Matters in CMMC 2.0:

Assessors must ensure that the amount of evidence collected isadequate to substantiate findingswithout doubt or gaps.

This prevents situations where an organization might claim compliance but lacks thenecessary documentation, technical evidence, or procedural validationto prove it.

Official CMMC 2.0 References:

TheCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guidedefines sufficiency as a key factor in validating assessment findings.

According toCMMC 2.0 Level 2 Scoping Guidance, assessors must apply sufficiency criteria when reviewingartifacts, documentation, interviews, and system configurations.

TheDoD CMMC Assessment Guide(aligned with NIST SP 800-171A) emphasizes that compliance decisions must besupported by a sufficient amount of verifiable evidence.

Comparison with Other Criteria:

Adequacy Criteria# Focuses onqualityof the evidence, not the quantity.

Objectivity Criteria# Ensures evidence isunbiased and impartial, not necessarily complete.

Subjectivity Criteria# Not applicable in CMMC since assessments must beobjective and based on factual evidence.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:Conclusion:To verify compliance in CMMC 2.0 assessments, the assessment team must ensuresufficientevidence is available to support a determination. This makes"Sufficiency Criteria" (Option C)the correct answer.

Exercising due care to ensure the information gathered during the assessment is protected even after the engagement has ended meets which code of conduct requirement?

A. Availability

B. Confidentiality

C. Information Integrity

D. Respect for Intellectual Property Answer: B

Explanation

The requirement to exercise due care in protecting information gathered during an assessment aligns with the principle ofConfidentialityunder theCMMC Code of Professional Conduct (CoPC). This ensures that sensitive assessment data, findings, and any Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) remain protected even after the engagement concludes.

Definition of Confidentiality in CMMC Context:

Confidentiality refers to protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure.

In the context of a CMMC assessment, it includes safeguarding assessment artifacts, findings, and other sensitive data collected during the evaluation process.

CMMC Code of Professional Conduct (CoPC) References:

TheCMMC Code of Professional Conductstates that assessors and organizations must handle all collected information with discretion andensure its protection post-engagement.

Clause on"Maintaining Confidentiality"specifies that assessors must:

Not disclose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

Secure data in storage and transmission.

Retain and dispose of data securely in accordance with federal regulations.

Alignment with NIST 800-171 & CMMC Practices:

CMMC Level 2 incorporates NIST SP 800-171 controls, which include:

Requirement 3.1.3:“Control CUI at rest and in transit” to ensure unauthorized individuals do not gain access. Requirement 3.1.4:“Separate the duties of individuals to reduce risk” ensures that assessment findings are only shared with authorized personnel.

These requirements align with the duty toexercise due carein protecting assessment-related information.

Answer: A

Explanation

The CAP makes clear that evidence collected during the assessment is evaluated for both adequacy (does the evidence align with the requirement) and sufficiency (is there enough evidence to make a confident determination).

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CAP v2.0, Evidence Collection Guidance: “Evidence must be evaluated for adequacy… and for

sufficiency, to ensure enough information is available to support the assessor’s determination.” Why Option A is Correct:

Evidence is assessed based on two qualities only: adequacy and sufficiency.

“Thoroughness” and “appropriateness” are not official CAP terms for evidence evaluation. References (Official CMMC v2.0 Content):

The government services division interacts exclusively with federal clients and regularly receives FCI. The commercial services division interacts exclusively with non-federal clients and processes only publicly available information. For this company's CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment, how should the assets supporting the commercial services division be categorized?

A. FCI Assets

B. Specialized Assets

C. Out-of-Scope Assets

D. Operational Technology Assets Answer: C

Explanation

Understanding CMMC Asset CategorizationTheCMMC 2.0 Scoping Guidedefines how assets are categorized based on their involvement withFederal Contract Information (FCI)andControlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

In this scenario:

Thegovernment services divisioninteracts withfederal clientsandreceives FCI, making its assetsin-scopefor CMMC Level 1.

Thecommercial services divisioninteractsonly with non-federal clientsanddoes not handle FCI—this means its assets arenot subject to CMMC Level 1 requirementsand should be classified asOut-of-Scope Assets. CMMC 2.0 Definition of Out-of-Scope AssetsAs per theCMMC Scoping Guide, assets that:

#Do not store, process, or transmit FCI/CUI #Do not directly impact the security of in-scope assets #Are completely segregated from the FCI/CUI environment

are classified asOut-of-Scope Assets.

Since thecommercial services divisiononly processespublicly available information and has no interaction with FCI, its assets areout-of-scopefor CMMC Level 1 assessment.

A. FCI Assets#Incorrect. FCI assets areonly those that store, process, or transmit FCI. The commercial services division doesnothandle FCI, so its assets donotqualify.

B. Specialized Assets#Incorrect. Specialized assets refer toInternet of Things (IoT), Operational Technology (OT), and test equipment. These donot applyto a general commercial services division.

D. Operational Technology Assets#Incorrect.Operational Technology (OT) Assetsinvolveindustrial control systems, SCADA, and manufacturing equipment—which are not relevant to this scenario.

Question #:82 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] Which statement BEST describes an assessor's evidence gathering activities?

A. Use interviews for assessing a Level 2 practice.

B. Test all practices or objectives for a Level 2 practice

C. Test certain assessment objectives to determine findings.

D. Use examinations, interviews, and tests to gather sufficient evidence. Answer: D

Explanation

Under theCMMC Assessment Process (CAP)andCMMC 2.0 guidelines, assessors must gather objective evidence to validate that an organization meets the required security practices and processes. This evidence collection is performed throughthree primary assessment methods:

Examination– Reviewing documents, records, system configurations, and other artifacts.

Interviews– Speaking with personnel to verify processes, responsibilities, and understanding of security controls.

Testing– Observing system behavior, performing technical validation, and executing controls in real-time to verify effectiveness.

TheCMMC Assessment Process (CAP)states that an assessor must use acombinationof evidence-gathering methods (examinations, interviews, and tests) to determine compliance.

CMMC 2.0 Level 2(Aligned withNIST SP 800-171) requires assessors to verify not only that policies and procedures exist but also that they are implemented and effective.

Solely relying ononemethod (like interviews in Option A) is insufficient.

Testing all practices or objectives (Option B)is unnecessary, as assessors followscoping guidanceto determine which objectives need deeper examination.

Testing only "certain" objectives (Option C)does not fully align with the requirement of gatheringsufficient evidencefrom multiple methods.

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide, Section 3.5 – Assessment Methodsexplicitly defines the use of examinations, interviews, and tests as the foundation of an effective assessment.

CMMC 2.0 Level 2 Practices and NIST SP 800-171require assessors to validate the presence, implementation, and effectiveness of security controls.

Question #:84 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] Contractor scoping requirements for a CMMC Level 2 Assessment to document the asset in an inventory, in the SSP and on the network diagram apply to:

A. GUI Assets.

B. CUI and Security Protection Asset categories.

C. all asset categories except for the Out-of-scope Assets.

D. Contractor Risk Managed Assets and Specialized Assets. Answer: B

Explanation

UnderCMMC Level 2, contractors are required toidentify, document, and categorize assetsinvolved in handlingControlled Unclassified Information (CUI). This is part of thescoping process, which ensures that all security-relevant assets are properly protected and accounted for in the System Security Plan (SSP), asset inventory, and network diagram.

CMMC Scoping Requirements for Level 2 Assessments:

TheCMMC Scoping Guide(CMMC v2.0) identifies four asset categories:

CUI Assets:Systems that store, process, or transmit CUI.

Security Protection Assets (SPA):Systems providing security functions for CUI Assets (e.g., firewalls, SIEMs).

Leaders in it certification

101 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMA):Assets that interact with CUI but arenot directly controlledby the organization (e.g., personal devices).

Specialized Assets:These include IoT devices, OT systems, and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) thatmay require specific security controls.

Where Documentation is Required:

The contractor mustdocument all assets (except out-of-scope assets)in:

The System Security Plan (SSP):A key document detailing security controls and asset categorization.

An asset inventory:Lists all in-scope assets (CUI Assets, SPAs, CRMA, and Specialized Assets).

The network diagram:Provides a visual representation of system connectivity and security boundaries. Why Out-of-Scope Assets Are Excluded:

TheCMMC Scoping Guidespecifically states that Out-of-Scope Assets arenot required to be documentedin these compliance artifacts because they haveno direct or indirect interaction with CUI.

These assets do not require CMMC controls because they are completely isolated from CUI handling environments.

Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) GUI Assets:There is no specific "GUI Asset" category in CMMC scoping.

(B) CUI and Security Protection Asset categories:While these are included, this answerexcludesContractor Risk Managed and Specialized Assets, which are also required.

(D) Contractor Risk Managed Assets and Specialized Assets:These assetsare included in scopingbut this answer excludes CUI Assets and Security Protection Assets, making it incomplete.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:Final Validation from CMMC Documentation:According to theCMMC Assessment Scope Level 2 Guide, allin-scope assetsmust be documented in the SSP, inventory, and network diagram.The only assets excluded are Out-of-Scope Assets.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C. All asset categories except for the Out-of-Scope Assets.

Explanation

Understanding the Role of an FCI Asset in CMMCAdedicated local printer used to print Federal Contract Information (FCI)is considered anFCI Asset. UnderCMMC Level 1, FCI assets are required to meetbasic cybersecurity controlsto ensure that FCI is properlyprotected from unauthorized access.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:#1. Why "Process" is the Best Answer The printerreceives digital FCI, converts it into a physical format (paper), and outputs the document. This aligns with thedefinition of "processing" in CMMC, which includes:

Transforming or modifying data Generating output (e.g., printed documents) Using systems to interpret or manipulate information #2. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) Encrypt#

Aprinter does not encryptFCI—it simply prints it. Encryption applies todigital storage and transmission, not printing.

(B) Manage#

Managing FCI typically refers togovernance, access control, and oversight, which is not the function of a printer.

(D) Distribute#

While a printed documentcould be distributed, theprinter itself is not responsible for distributing FCI—it only processes the data for output.

CMMC Assessment Guide (Level 1)confirms thatprocessing FCI includes using systems that convert or transform information, such as printers.

NIST SP 800-171definesprocessingas an action thatchanges or manipulates information, which applies to printing.

A. In scope, because it is an asset that stores FCI

B. In scope, because it is part of the same physical location

C. Out of scope, because they are all only paper documents

D. Out of scope, because it does not process or transmit FCI Answer: D

Explanation

Does a File Cabinet Containing Paper FCI Fall Within CMMC Scope?CMMConly applies to digital systems and assetsthatprocess, store, or transmitFederal Contract Information (FCI)andControlled Unclassified Information (CUI).Physical storage (such as paper documents) is not included in CMMC scoping. Step-by-Step Breakdown:#1. CMMC Scope Covers Only Digital Systems and Assets According to theCMMC Scoping Guide (Level 1),only digital assetsthat handleFCIarein scopefor aLevel 1 Self-Assessment.

Afile cabinetisnot a digital system; therefore, it isnot in scopefor CMMC compliance.

#2. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) In scope, because it is an asset that stores FCI#

Incorrect:While the file cabinetdoes store FCI,CMMC only applies to digital systems.

(B) In scope, because it is part of the same physical location#

Incorrect:CMMCdoes notconsiderphysical proximitywhen determining scope—only digital data handling matters.

(D) Out of scope, because it does not process or transmit FCI#

Partially correct, but incomplete: Themain reasonit is out of scope is that itcontains only paper documents, not that it doesn’t process/transmit data.

TheCMMC Level 1 Scoping Guideexplicitly states thatpaper-based storage of FCI does not fall within scope. Final Validation from CMMC Documentation:Thus, the correct answer is:

CMMC Level 1 includes 17 practices derived fromFAR 52.204-21. Among them, theMedia Protection (MP) practicerequires organizations to ensure thatmedia containing FCI is sanitized or destroyed before disposal or release for reuseto prevent unauthorized access.

This requirement ensures that any storage devices, hard drives, USBs, or physical documents containingFederal Contract Information (FCI)areproperly disposed of or sanitizedto prevent data leakage.

The evidence collected for this practice should demonstrate that an organization has established and followed propermedia sanitization or destruction procedures.

Why the Correct Answer is "B. Adequate"?TheCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guideoutlines that for an assessment to be considered complete, all submitted evidence must meet the standard ofadequacybefore it is accepted by the Lead Assessor.

Definition of "Adequate" Evidence in CMMC:

Evidence isadequatewhen itfully demonstrates that a practice has been performed as requiredby CMMC guidelines.

TheLead Assessorevaluates whether the submitted documentation meets the CMMC 2.0 Level 1 requirements. If the evidenceaccurately and completely demonstrates the sanitization or destruction of media containing FCI, then it meets the standard ofadequacy.

Why Not the Other Options?

A. Official– While the evidence may come from an official source, the CMMCdoes not require evidence to be "official", only that it beadequateto confirm compliance.

C. Compliant– Compliance is the final result of an assessment, but before compliance is determined, the evidence must first beadequatefor evaluation.

D. Subjective– CMMC evidence isobjective, meaning it should be based on verifiable documents, policies, logs, and procedures—not opinions or interpretations.

CMMC 2.0 Scoping Guide (Nov 2021)– Specifies that Media Protection (MP) at Level 1 applies only to assets that process, store, or transmit FCI.

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Explanation

Under the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, a Plan of Action (POA) is a critical document that outlines the specific actions a contractor needs to take to remediate cybersecurity deficiencies. While POAs serve as a roadmap for achieving compliance with required controls, the inclusion of certain elements is standardized.

Key Elements of a Plan of Action (POA) According to the CMMC guidelines and NIST SP 800-171, which underpins many CMMC requirements, a POA typically includes:

Completion Dates: Identifies target deadlines for resolving deficiencies.

Milestones to Measure Progress: Includes interim steps or markers to ensure progress is monitored over time. Ownership or Accountability: Clearly assigns responsibility for each action item to specific personnel or teams.

What is Generally NOT Part of a POA?

Budget requirements to implement the plan's remediation actions (Option D) are generally not included in a POA. While budgeting is critical for ensuring the plan's success, it is considered a part of the broaderproject management or resource planning process, not the POA itself. This distinction is intentional to keep the POA focused on actionable items rather than resource allocation.

Supporting Reference NIST SP 800-171A, Appendix D: Provides an overview of POA components, emphasizing the prioritization of corrective actions, responsibility, and measurable outcomes.

CMMC Level 2 Practices (Aligned with NIST SP 800-171): Specifically, the focus is on actions, timelines, and accountability rather than financial planning.

By excluding budget details, the POA remains a tactical document that supports immediate action and compliance tracking, separate from financial considerations.

Answer: A

Explanation

Who Has the Final Authority Over Assessment Results?During aCMMC Level 2 assessment, theCertified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO)is responsible for conducting and finalizing the assessment results.

Key Responsibilities of a C3PAO#Leads the assessmentand ensures it follows the CMMC Assessment Process (CAP).

#Validates compliancewith CMMC Level 2 requirements based onNIST SP 800-171controls.

#Finalizes the assessment resultsand submits them to theCMMC-ABand theDoD.

#Handles disagreementsfrom the OSC but hasfinal decision-making authorityon results.

The C3PAO has final authority over the assessment resultsafter considering all evidence and findings. TheCMMC-AB (Option B) does not finalize assessments—it accredits C3PAOs and manages the certification ecosystem.

TheAssessment Team (Option C) supports the C3PAO but does not have final decision authority. TheAssessment Sponsor (Option D) is a representative from the OSC and does not control the results.

Why "C3PAO" is Correct?Breakdown of Answer ChoicesOption Description Correct?

A. C3PAO

Question #:94 - [CMMC Ecosystem] A CMMC Assessment is being conducted at an OSC's HQ. which is a shared workspace in a multi-tenant building. The OSC is renting four offices on the first floor that can be locked individually. The first-floor conference room is shared with other tenants but has been reserved to conduct the assessment. The conference room has a desk with a drawer that does not lock. At the end of the day, an evidence file that had been sent by email is reviewed. What is the BEST way to handle this file?

A. Review it. print it, and put it in the desk drawer.

B. Review it, and make notes on the computer provided by the client.

C. Review it, print it, make notes, and then shred it in cross-cut shredder in the print room.

D. Review it. print it, and leave it in a folder on the table together with the other documents. Answer: C

Explanation

In the context of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, particularly at Level 2, organizations are required to implement stringent controls to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). This includes adhering to specific practices related to media protection and physical security.

Media Protection (MP):

MP.L2-3.8.1 – Media Protection:Organizations must protect (i.e., physically control and securely store) system media containing CUI, both paper and digital. This ensures that sensitive information is not accessible to unauthorized individuals.

Defense Innovation Unit MP.L2-3.8.3 – Media Disposal:It is imperative to sanitize or destroy information system media containing CUI before disposal or release for reuse. This practice prevents potential data breaches from discarded or repurposed media.

Defense Innovation Unit Physical Protection (PE):

PE.L2-3.10.2 – Monitor Facility:Organizations are required to protect and monitor the physical facility and support infrastructure for organizational systems. This includes ensuring that areas where CUI is processed or stored are secure and access is controlled.

Defense Innovation Unit Application to the Scenario:

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Given that the Organization Seeking Certification (OSC) operates within a shared, multi-tenant building and utilizes a common conference room for assessments, the following considerations are crucial:

Reviewing the Evidence File:The evidence file, which contains CUI, should be reviewed on a secure, authorized device to prevent unauthorized access or potential data leakage.

Printing the Evidence File:If printing is necessary, ensure that the printer is located in a secure area, and the printed documents are retrieved immediately to prevent unauthorized viewing.

Making Notes:Any notes derived from the evidence file should be treated with the same level of security as the original document, especially if they contain CUI.

Disposal of Printed Materials:After the assessment, all printed materials and notes containing CUI must be destroyed using a cross-cut shredder. Cross-cut shredding ensures that the information cannot be reconstructed, thereby maintaining confidentiality.

Options A and D are inadequate as they involve leaving sensitive information in unsecured locations, which violates CMMC physical security requirements. Option B, while secure in terms of digital handling, does not address the proper disposal of any physical copies that may have been made. Therefore, Option C is the best practice, aligning with CMMC 2.0 guidelines by ensuring that all physical media containing CUI are properly reviewed, securely stored during use, and thoroughly destroyed when no longer needed.

Explanation

Understanding the Reporting Process in a CMMC 2.0 Level 2 AssessmentACMMC Level 2 Assessmentconducted by aCertified Third-Party Assessor Organization (C3PAO)follows a structured approach to gathering evidence, evaluating compliance, and reporting findings to theOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC). The reporting process is outlined in theCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide, which specifies how findings should be communicated.

Daily Checkpoints:

Throughout the assessment, the assessor team holdsdaily checkpoint meetingswith the OSC to provide updates on progress, observations, and preliminary findings.

These checkpoints help ensure transparency and allow the OSC to address minor issues as they arise.

Final Results Delivery:

Thefinal assessment resultsare typically shared during thefinal daily checkpointOR in aseparately scheduled findings and recommendations reviewmeeting.

This ensures that the OSC receives a structured and complete summary of the assessment findings before the official report is submitted.

TheCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide, Section 4.5clearly states that assessment findings should be presentedeither at the last daily checkpoint or during a separately scheduled final review.

This aligns with best practices formaintaining transparency and ensuring the OSC has clarity on their assessment resultsbefore the final report submission.

Option A (End of every day)is incorrect because while assessors do provide updates, they do not deliver the "final results" daily.

Option B (Daily and a separate final review)is misleading, as the CAP Guide allows assessors tochoosebetween the final daily checkpoint OR a separate findings review—not both.

Option D (After C3PAO approval)is incorrect because theC3PAO does not approve findings before they are communicated to the OSC. The assessment team directly presents the results first.

Question #:109 - [CMMC Ecosystem] Within the CMMC Ecosystem which organization ultimately will manage and oversee the training, testing, authorization, and certification of candidate assessors and instructors?

A. DoD OUSD

B. DIB Collaborative Information Sharing Environment

C. Committee on National Security Systems Instructions

D. CMMC Assessors and Instructors Certification Organization Answer: D

Explanation

Understanding the Role of CAICO in the CMMC EcosystemTheCMMC Ecosystemconsists of multiple organizations that manage, implement, and oversee different aspects of theCybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)program.

One of the key organizations is theCMMC Assessors and Instructors Certification Organization (CAICO), which is responsible for:

Training and certifying assessors and instructors.

Managing testing, authorization, and certificationfor CMMC professionals.

Ensuring assessors meet qualification and compliance standards.

TheCAICO is explicitly taskedwith thetraining, testing, authorization, and certification of candidate assessors and instructors.

Option A (DoD OUSD)is incorrect because theDoD Office of the Under Secretary of Defense(OUSD) provides policy oversight butdoes not handle certification of assessors.

Option B (DIB Collaborative Information Sharing Environment)is incorrect because theDIB CISfocuses on information sharing within the Defense Industrial Base, not assessor certification.

Option C (Committee on National Security Systems Instructions)is incorrect because CNSSI provides security standards butdoes not manage assessor training or certification.

Question #:110 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] An assessment is being conducted at a remote client site. For the duration of the assessment, the client has provided a designated hoteling space in their secure facility which consists of a desk with access to a shared printer. After noticing that the desk does not lock, a locked cabinet is requested but the client does not have one available. At the end of the day, the client provides a printout copy of an important network diagram. The diagram is clearly marked and contains CUI. What should be done NEXT to protect the document?

A. Take it with them to review in the evening.

B. Leave it on the desk for review the following day.

C. Put it in the unlocked desk drawer for review the following morning.

D. Take a picture with the personal phone before securely shredding it. Answer: D

Explanation

Understanding CUI Handling and Storage RequirementsControlled Unclassified Information (CUI) must beprotected from unauthorized access and properly storedperCMMC 2.0 Level 2 requirementsandNIST SP 800-171 controls. Key requirements include:

NIST SP 800-171 (Requirement 3.8.3)– CUI must bephysically protectedwhen not in use.

NIST SP 800-171 (Requirement 3.1.3)– CUI access should berestricted to authorized personnel only. DoD CUI Program Guidance– Ifproper storage (e.g., locked cabinets or controlled access areas) is unavailable, CUI should be returned to an authorized individual or secure facility.

A. Take it with them to review in the evening # Incorrect

CUI should never be removed from a secure facility unless explicitly authorizedand handled in accordance with security policies (e.g., encrypted electronic transport, secure physical storage).

B. Leave it on the desk for review the following day # Incorrect

Leaving CUI unattendedon an open desk violatesCUI physical protection requirements.

C. Put it in the unlocked desk drawer for review the following morning # Incorrect Anunlocked drawer does not meet CUI physical security storage requirements.

D. Take a picture with the personal phone before securely shredding it # Incorrect Storing CUI on an unauthorized personal device is a serious security violationandunauthorized reproduction of CUI is prohibited.

Why None of the Provided Answers Are Fully Correct What Should Be Done Instead?#Return the document to the client for secure storage.

Since nosecure storage optionis available, thedocument must be returnedto the client, who should store it in anapproved secure location (e.g., a locked cabinet or classified storage area).

Theassessment team should not retain CUI unless they have an approved method of safeguarding it.

NIST SP 800-171 (Requirement 3.8.3 – Media Protection) RequiresCUI to be physically securedwhen not in use.

DFARS 252.204-7012 (Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting) Establishes CUIstorage and handling protections.

CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (Advanced) Requirements Requires organizations toimplement physical security controlsto protect CUI.

DoD CUI Program Guidelines Clearly state thatCUI must be stored in locked cabinets or controlled-access areaswhen not actively in use. CMMC 2.0 References Supporting This Answer:

D. insufficient, and re-rate the audit finding after a quarter two assessment report is examined. Answer: B

Explanation

CA.L2-3.12.1:"Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application."

This control is derived fromNIST SP 800-171, Requirement 3.12.1, which mandates organizations to performregular security control assessmentsto ensure compliance and effectiveness.

Evidence Review & Assessment Timeline:

The organization's procedureexplicitly statesthat security control assessments must be conductedquarterly (every three months).

Since the Lead Assessor only has access to thefirst-quarter report, the second-quarter report is missing at the time of assessment.

CMMC Audit Requirements:

For an assessor to rate a control asMET, sufficient evidence must bereadily availableat the time of evaluation. Since the second-quarter report is missingat the time of assessment, the Lead Assessorcannot verify compliancewith the organization's own stated frequency of assessment.

Why the Answer is NOT A, C, or D:

A (Sufficient, MET)#Incorrect: The control assessment frequency is quarterly, but the evidence for Q2 is not available. Compliance cannot be confirmed.

C (Sufficient, and re-rate later)#Incorrect: If evidence is not available during the audit, the controlcannot be rated as MET initially. There is no provision in CMMC 2.0 to "conditionally" pass a control pending future evidence.

D (Insufficient, but re-rate later)#Incorrect: Once a control is ratedNOT MET, it staysNOT METuntil a reassessment is conducted in a new audit cycle. The assessordoes not adjust ratings retroactivelybased on future evidence.

Control Reference: CA.L2-3.12.1Assessment Criteria & Justification for the Correct Answer:

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide (2023):

"For a control to be rated as MET, the assessed organization must provide sufficient evidence at the time of the assessment."

"If evidence is missing or incomplete, the finding shall be rated as NOT MET."

NIST SP 800-171A (Security Requirement Assessment Guide):

"Evidence must be current, relevant, and sufficient to demonstrate compliance with stated periodicity requirements."

Since the procedure mandatesquarterly assessments, missing evidence means compliancecannot be validated. DoD CMMC Scoping Guidance:

"Assessors shall base their determination on the evidence provided at the time of assessment. If required evidence is not available, the control shall be rated as NOT MET."

Official CMMC 2.0 References Supporting the Answer:

Final Conclusion:Thecorrect answer is Bbecause the required evidence (the second-quarter report) is not availableat the time of assessment, making itinsufficientto validate compliance. The Lead Assessormust rate the control as NOT METin accordance with CMMC 2.0 assessment rules.

Question #:112 - [CMMC Model Overview] A defense contractor needs to share FCI with a subcontractor and sends this data in an email. The email system involved in this process is being used to:

A. manage FCI.

B. process FCI.

C. transmit FCI.

D. generate FCI Answer: C

Explanation

Federal Contract Information (FCI) is defined inFAR 52.204-21as information provided by or generated for the government under contract but not intended for public release. UnderCMMC 2.0, organizations handling FCI must implementFAR 52.204-21 Basic Safeguarding Requirements, ensuring proper protection inprocessing, storing, and transmittingFCI.

Analyzing the Given OptionsThe question involves an email system that is used tosendFCI to a subcontractor. Let’s break down the possible answers:

A. Manage FCI# Incorrect

Managing FCI involves activities like organizing, storing, and maintaining access to FCI. Sending an email does not fall under management; it is an act of transmission.

B. Process FCI# Incorrect

Processing refers to actively using FCI for operational or analytical purposes, such as analyzing, modifying, or computing data. Simply sending an email does not constitute processing.

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

C. Transmit FCI# Correct

Transmission refers to the act of sending FCI from one entity to another. Since the contractor issendingFCI via email, this falls undertransmittingthe data.

Reference:NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, 3.1.3– "Control CUI (or FCI) by transmitting it using authorized mechanisms."

D. Generate FCI# Incorrect

Generating FCI means creating new contract-related information. The contractor is not creating FCI in this scenario but merely transmitting it.

Official References Supporting the Correct AnswerCMMC 2.0 Level 1 Practices (FAR 52.204-21 Basic Safeguarding Controls)

3.1.3: "Control CUI (or FCI) by transmitting it using authorized mechanisms."

This confirms that email transmission falls under"transmitting" FCI, not managing or processing.

NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 (Protecting CUI in Non-Federal Systems) Requirement 3.13.8: "Implement cryptographic methods to protect CUI when transmitted."

While this applies more to CUI, FCI should also be protected during transmission, confirming that email is a form oftransmittinginformation.

ConclusionSince the contractor issendingFCI via email, the correct answer isC. Transmit FCI.This aligns withCMMC 2.0 Level 1practices underFAR 52.204-21andNIST SP 800-171, which emphasize securing transmitted data.

CMMC 2.0 Level 2 is directly aligned withNIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, "Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations."Organizations seeking certification (OSC) at Level 2 must demonstrate compliance with the 110 security requirements specified inNIST SP 800171, as mandated byDFARS 252.204-7012.

Defines the Security Requirements for Protecting CUI:

NIST SP 800-171 outlines 110 security controls that contractors must implement to protectControlled Unclassified Information (CUI)in nonfederal systems.

These controls are categorized under14 families, including access control, incident response, and risk management.

Establishes the Baseline for CMMC Level 2 Compliance:

CMMC 2.0 Level 2 assessments areentirely based on NIST SP 800-171requirements.

Every practice assessed in a Level 2 certification maps directly to a requirement fromNIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2. Provides Guidance for Implementation & Assessment:

TheNIST SP 800-171A "Assessment Guide"provides detailed assessment objectives that guide OSCs in preparing for CMMC evaluations.

It helps define the scope of an assessment by clarifying how each control should be implemented and verified. Referenced in CMMC and DFARS Regulations:

DFARS 252.204-7012requires contractors to implementNIST SP 800-171security requirements.

TheCMMC 2.0 Level 2modeldirectly incorporates all 110 requirementsfromNIST SP 800-171, ensuring consistency with DoD cybersecurity expectations.

A. NIST SP 800-53 ("Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations") This documentapplies to federal systems, not nonfederal entities handling CUI.

While it is the foundation for other security standards, it isnot the basis of CMMC Level 2assessments.

B. NIST SP 800-88 ("Guidelines for Media Sanitization")

This documentfocuses on secure data destructionand media sanitization techniques.

While data disposal is important, this standarddoes not define security controls for protecting CUI.

D. NIST SP 800-172 ("Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting CUI")

#The deficiency identified in Phase 2 has been fully corrected before final scoring.

#Sufficient evidence is provided to demonstrate compliance with the CMMC requirement.

#The correction is notmerely plannedbutfully implemented and validatedby the assessors.

Since the evidence shows thatdeficiencies have been corrected, the correct score isMET.

B. POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)#Incorrect. APOA&M (Plan of Action and Milestones)is usedonly when a deficiency remains unresolved. Since the deficiency is already corrected, this option does not apply.

C. NOT MET#Incorrect. A practice is scoredNOT METonly if the deficiency hasnotbeen corrected by the end of the assessment.

D. NOT APPLICABLE#Incorrect. A practice is markedNOT APPLICABLE (N/A)only if it doesnot apply to the organization’s environment, which is not the case here.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Document– Defines scoring criteria for MET, NOT MET, and POA&M. CMMC Official ReferencesThus,option A (MET) is the correct answer, as the deficiencies have been corrected before final scoring.

Understanding FAR Clause 52.204-21TheFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.204-21is titled" Basic Safeguarding of Covered Contractor Information Systems."This clause establishesminimum cybersecurity requirementsforfederal contractorsthat handleFederal Contract Information (FCI).

Key Purpose of FAR Clause 52.204-21Theprimary objectiveof FAR 52.204-21 is to ensure that contractors applybasic cybersecurity protectionsto theirinformation systemsthat process, store, or transmitFCI. Theseminimum safeguarding requirementsserve as abaseline security standardfor contractors doing business with theU.S. government.

FAR 52.204-21 doesnotrequire contractors to install specific cybersecurity tools (eliminating option A). Itoutlines only the minimum safeguards, notallcybersecurity controls needed for complete security (eliminating option B).

CMMC certification isnotmandated by this clause alone (eliminating option D).

Instead, it establishesa baseline "standard of care"that all federal contractorsmust followto protectFCI(making option C correct).

Why "Minimum Standard of Care" is Correct?Breakdown of Answer ChoicesOption Description Correct?

A. It directs all covered contractors to install the cybersecurity systems listed in that clause. #Incorrect–The clause doesnotspecify tools or require specific cybersecurity systems.

B. It describes all of the safeguards that contractors must take to secure covered contractor IS. #Incorrect–It only setsminimumrequirements, notall possiblesecurity measures.

C. It describes the minimum standard of care that contractors must take to secure covered contractor IS. #Correct – The clause defines basic safeguards as a minimum security standard.

D. It directs covered contractors to obtain CMMC Certification at the level equal to the lowest requirement of their contracts.

A. process and transmit FCI.

B. process and organize FCI.

C. store, process, and transmit FCI.

D. store, process, and organize FCI. Answer: C

Explanation

Understanding FCI and Asset CategorizationFederal Contract Information (FCI)is any informationnot intended for public releasethat is provided by or generated for thegovernmentunder aDoD contract. Acompany-issued laptopused by a sales representative to enter FCI into aspreadsheetis considered anFCI assetbecause it:

#Stores FCI– The spreadsheet contains sensitive information.

#Processes FCI– The representative is entering data into the spreadsheet.

#Organizes FCI– The spreadsheet helps structure and manage FCI data.

Processing (Option B and C)is occurring, but since the laptop is primarily being used toorganize data,Option D is the most comprehensive.

Transmission (Option A and C)is not explicitly mentioned, soOption D is the best fit.

Question #:125 - [CMMC Ecosystem] A CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment identified an asset in the OSC's facility that does not process, store, or transmit FCI. Which type of asset is this considered?

A. FCI Assets

B. Specialized Assets

C. Out-of-Scope Assets

D. Government-Issued Assets Answer: C

Explanation

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 framework categorizes assets based on their interaction with Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). In a CMMC Level 1 self-assessment, assets are classified based on whether they process, store, or transmit FCI. FCI Assets– These assets process, store, or transmit FCI and must meet CMMC Level 1 security requirements (17 practices from FAR 52.204-21).

CUI Assets– These assets handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and are subject to CMMC Level 2 requirements, aligned with NIST SP 800-171.

Specialized Assets– Includes IoT devices, Operational Technology (OT), Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE), and test equipment. These are often categorized separately due to their specific cybersecurity requirements.

Out-of-Scope Assets– Assets that do not process, store, or transmit FCI or CUI. These do not require compliance with CMMC practices.

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Government-Issued Assets– These are assets provided by the government for contract-specific purposes, often requiring compliance based on government policies.

The question specifies that the identified assetdoes not process, store, or transmit FCI.

According to CMMC 2.0 guidelines,only assets that handle FCI or CUI are subject to security controls. Assets that are physically located within an OSC’s facility but do not interact with FCI or CUI fall into the" Out-of-Scope Assets"category.

These assets do not require CMMC-specific cybersecurity controls, as they have no impact on the security of FCI or CUI.

CMMC Scoping Guide (Nov 2021)– Definesout-of-scope assetsas those that are within an OSC’s environment but have no interaction with FCI or CUI.

CMMC 2.0 Level 1 Guide– Only requires security controls on FCI assets, meaning assets that do not process, store, or transmit FCI are out of scope.

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide– Identifies the classification of assets in an OSC’s environment to determine compliance requirements.

Asset Categories as per CMMC 2.0:Why the Correct Answer is C. Out-of-Scope Assets?Relevant CMMC 2.0 References:Final Justification:Since the assetdoes not process, store, or transmit FCI, it does not fall under "FCI Assets" or "Specialized Assets." It is also not a government-issued asset. Therefore, the correct classification under CMMC 2.0 isOut-of-Scope Assets (C).

Question #:128 - [CMMC Ecosystem] A C3PAO has completed a Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Evaluation following an assessment of an OSC. The Lead Assessor has recommended moving deficiencies to a POA&M. but the OSC will remain on an Interim Certification. What is the MINIMUM number of practices that must be scored as MET to initiate this course of action?

A. 80 practices

B. 88 practices

C. 100 practices

D. 110 practices Answer: C

Explanation

TheLimited Practice Deficiency Correction Evaluationprocess occurs when anOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC)has undergone aCMMC Level 2 Assessmentby aCertified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO)and hasunresolved deficienciesin some security practices.

According toCMMC 2.0 policy and DFARS 252.204-7021, OSCs can still achieveInterim Certificationif they meet theminimum thresholdof security practices while addressing deficiencies through aPlan of Action & Milestones (POA&M).

TheCMMC 2.0 Interim Rulestates that an OSCmust meet at least 100 out of 110 practicesto qualify for aPOA&M-based remediation.

A maximum of 10 practices can be listed in the POA&Mfor later correction.

Failure to meet at least 100 practices results in failing the assessment outright, requiring a full reassessment after remediation.

The Lead Assessor can recommend POA&M placementonly if the OSC meets at least 100 practices.

Less than 100 practices scored as MET means the OSC does not qualify for a POA&Mand mustretest completely.

DFARS 252.204-7021 and CMMC 2.0 policiesconfirm the100-practice thresholdfor conditional certification.

A. 80 practices (Incorrect)– Falls well below the 100-practice requirement.

B. 88 practices (Incorrect)– Still below the POA&M eligibility threshold.

D. 110 practices (Incorrect)– While meeting 110 practices would be ideal,CMMC allows a POA&M option at 100 practices.

The correct answer isC. 100 practices, as this meets theminimum threshold for POA&M-based Interim Certification.

Contractors handlingonly FCImust meetCMMC Level 1, which alignsdirectlywith the safeguarding requirements set inFAR 52.204-21.

2. FAR 52.204-21 and Its Role in CMMC Level 1 Compliance

FAR 52.204-21establishes the baseline cybersecurity controls that contractors must implement to protectFCI. The15 basic safeguarding requirementsinclude:

Limiting information accessto authorized users.

Identifying and authenticating usersbefore allowing system access.

Protecting transmitted FCIfrom unauthorized disclosure.

Monitoring and controlling connectionsto external systems.

Applying boundary protectionand cybersecurity measures.

Sanitizing mediabefore disposal.

Updating security configurationsto reduce vulnerabilities.

Providing physical securityprotections.

Controlling physical accessto systems that process FCI.

Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) where applicable.

Patching vulnerabilitiesin software and hardware.

Limiting the use of removable media.

Creating and retaining system audit logs.

Performing risk-based security assessments.

Developing an incident response plan.

These 15 practices form thefoundationof CMMCLevel 1 Self-Assessment, ensuring contractorsmeet minimum cybersecurity expectationsfor handling FCI.

3. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect

B. 22 CFR 120-130:

This refers toInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which controls the export of defense-related articles and services,notFCI safeguarding requirements.

C. DFARS 252.204-7011:

This clause refers toalternative line item structuresand does not pertain to cybersecurity or safeguarding FCI. D. DFARS 252.204-7021:

This clause enforcesCMMC requirementsbut doesnot definebasic safeguarding controls. It requires compliance with CMMC but does not specify the foundational requirements (which come fromFAR 52.20421for Level 1).

4. Official CMMC 2.0 Reference & Study Guide Alignment TheCMMC 2.0 model documentationconfirms that Level 1 is focused on the15 practices from FAR 52.204-21. TheDoD’s official CMMC Assessment Guidefor Level 1 explicitly states that meeting FAR 52.204-21 is therequirement for passing a Level 1 Self-Assessment.

TheCMMC 2.0 Scoping Guideclarifies that contractors handling onlyFCIand seekingLevel 1 certificationmust implementonly FAR 52.204-21security controls.

Question #:132 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] A Lead Assessor and an OSC's Assessment Official have agreed to have the Assessment results presented during the final Daily Checkpoint of the OSC's CMMC Level 2 Assessment. Which document MUST the Lead Assessor use to present assessment findings to the OSC?

A. CMMC POA&M Brief

B. CMMC Findings Brief

C. CMMC Assessment Tracker Tool

D. CMMC Recommended Findings template Answer: B

Explanation

According to the CMMC Assessment Process (CAP), the Lead Assessor must use the CMMC Findings Brief to formally present assessment results to the Organization Seeking Certification (OSC). The Findings Brief ensures consistency across assessments and provides the OSC with an official, standardized presentation of results, including observed strengths, weaknesses, and any non-conformities.

Question #:133 - [CMMC Model Overview] During an assessment, which phase of the process identifies conflicts of interest?

A. Analyze requirements.

B. Develop assessment plan.

C. Verify readiness to conduct assessment.

D. Generate final recommended assessment results. Answer: C

Explanation

In the CMMC assessment process, conflicts of interest must be identified early to ensure an impartial and objective evaluation of an organization's compliance with CMMC 2.0 requirements. The appropriate phase for identifying conflicts of interest is during the"Verify Readiness to Conduct Assessment"phase.

Assessment Planning & Conflict of Interest Consideration Before an assessment begins, theC3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization)or theDIBCAC (Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center) for DOD-led assessmentsmust confirm that there are no conflicts of interest between assessors and the organization being assessed.

A conflict of interest may arise if an assessor haspreviously worked for, consulted with, or provided direct assistance tothe organization under review.

CMMC Assessment Process and PhasesThe CMMC assessment process involves multiple steps, and the verification of readiness is acritical early phaseto ensure that the assessment is unbiased:

Analyze Requirements:This phase focuses on defining the assessment scope, but it does not include conflict of interest verification.

Develop Assessment Plan:This phase focuses on structuring the assessment methodology, not on identifying conflicts.

Verify Readiness to Conduct Assessment (Correct Answer):

At this stage, theC3PAO or assessment team must review potential conflicts of interest.

TheDefense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC)also ensures assessors do not have any prior relationships that could compromise the objectivity of the evaluation.

Final Interpretation Authority in the CMMC Assessment ProcessDuring aCMMC Level 2 assessment, several entities are involved in the process, including theOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC), Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO), Assessment Team Members, and the CMMC Accreditation Body (CMMC-AB).

Role of the C3PAO and Assessment Team:

TheCertified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO)is responsible for conducting the assessment and makinginitial recommended findingsbased on NIST SP 800-171 security requirements.

Assessment Team Members(Lead Assessor and support staff) conduct evaluations and submit theirrecommendationsto the C3PAO.

Final Interpretation Authority – CMMC-AB:

TheCMMC Accreditation Body (CMMC-AB)is responsible for ensuring consistency and accuracy in assessments.

If there is any dispute or need for clarification regarding findings, CMMC-AB provides the final interpretation and guidance.

This ensures uniformity in certification decisions across different C3PAOs.

Why CMMC-AB is the Correct Answer:

CMMC-AB has the ultimate authority over thequality assurance processfor assessments.

It reviewsremediation requests, challenges, or disputesfrom the OSC or C3PAO and makes final determinations.

The CMMC-AB maintains oversight to ensure assessmentsalign with CMMC 2.0 policies and DFARS 252.204-7021 requirements.

A. C3PAO– The C3PAO conducts the assessment and submits findings, butit does not have the final interpretation authority. Findings must pass through theCMMC-AB quality assurance process.

C. OSC Sponsor– The OSC (Organization Seeking Certification)cannot interpret findings; they can only respond to identified deficiencies and appeal assessments through CMMC-AB channels.

D. Assessment Team Members– The assessment teamrecommends findingsbut does not make final

interpretations. Their role is limited to conducting evaluations, collecting evidence, and submitting reports to the C3PAO.

Question #:138 - [CMMC Model Overview] The evidence needed for each practice and/or process is weight for:

A. adequacy and sufficiency.

B. adequacy and thoroughness.

C. sufficiency and thoroughness.

D. sufficiency and appropriateness. Answer: A

Explanation

During aCMMC assessment, organizations must provide evidence to demonstrate compliance with requiredpractices and processes. Assessors evaluate this evidence based on two key criteria:

Adequacy– Does the evidence meet the intent of the security requirement?

Sufficiency– Is there enough evidence to reasonably conclude that the practice/process is effectively implemented?

These principles are outlined in theCMMC Assessment Process Guide, which provides a structured approach for evaluating compliance.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:#1. Adequacy – Does the evidence fully meet the requirement?

Adequacyrefers to whether the evidence properly demonstrates that the security practice has been implemented as required.

Example: If an organization claims to enforceMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA), an assessor would checksystem configurations, login policies, and user authentication logsto confirm that MFA is actually in use. #2. Sufficiency – Is there enough evidence to support the claim?

Sufficiencymeans that there isenough supporting evidenceto prove compliance.

Example: If an organization providesonly one screenshot of an MFA login screen, that alone may not besufficient—additional logs, policies, and user records would help strengthen the case.

(B) Adequacy and Thoroughness#

Thoroughnessis not a defined metric in CMMC evidence evaluation.

The focus is onwhether the evidence meets the requirement (adequacy)and if there isenough of it (sufficiency).

(C) Sufficiency and Thoroughness#

Question #:139 - [CMMC Model Overview] Two network administrators are working together to determine a network configuration in preparation for CMMC. The administrators find that they disagree on a couple of small items. Which solution is the BEST way to ensure compliance with CMMC?

A. Consult with the CEO of the company.

B. Consult the CMMC Assessment Guides and NIST SP 800-171.

C. Go with the network administrator's ideas with the least stringent controls.

D. Go with the network administrator's ideas with the most stringent controls. Answer: B

Explanation

When preparing forCMMC compliance, organizations must ensure that theirnetwork configurations align with required cybersecurity controls. Ifnetwork administratorsdisagree on certain configurations, the mostobjective and accurateway to resolve the disagreement is by referencingofficial CMMC guidanceandNIST SP 800-171 requirements, which form the foundation of CMMC Level 2.

CMMC Assessment Guides as the Primary Reference TheCMMC Assessment Guides (Level 1 & Level 2)provide clearinterpretationsof security practices. Theyexplain how each practice should be implemented and assessedduring certification.

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

CMMC Level 2is based directly onNIST SP 800-171, which outlines the110 security controlsrequired for protectingControlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

Network configurations must complywith NIST-defined security requirements, including:

Access Control (AC) – Ensuring least privilege principles.

Audit and Accountability (AU) – Logging and monitoring network activity.

System and Communications Protection (SC) – Secure network design and encryption.

Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) Consult with the CEO of the company:

ACEO is not necessarily a cybersecurity expertand may not be familiar with CMMC technical requirements. Technical compliance decisions should be based onCMMC and NISTframeworks, not executive opinions.

(C) Go with the network administrator's ideas with the least stringent controls:

Choosingless stringent controls increases security riskand could lead toCMMC non-compliance.

(D) Go with the network administrator's ideas with the most stringent controls:

While security is important,more stringent controlsmay introduceoperational inefficienciesorunnecessary coststhat are not required for compliance.

The correct approach is to implement what is required by CMMC and NIST SP 800-171, no more and no less. TheCMMC Assessment GuidesandNIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2areofficial sourcesthat provide the most reliable guidance on compliance.

CMMC Level 2 is entirely based on NIST SP 800-171, making it the definitive source for resolving security disagreements.

Explanation

In the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) assessment process, the presentation of the Final Recommended Assessment Findings is a critical step. According to the CMMC Assessment Process guidelines, the Lead Assessor is responsible for compiling and presenting these findings. The prescribed method for this presentation is the utilization of the standardized CMMC Findings Brief template. Step-by-Step Explanation:

Responsibility of the Lead Assessor:

The Lead Assessor oversees the assessment process and is tasked with compiling the Final Recommended Assessment Findings.

Utilization of the CMMC Findings Brief Template:

To ensure consistency and adherence to CMMC standards, the Lead Assessor must use the official CMMC Findings Brief template when presenting the assessment findings.

Presentation of Findings:

The findings, documented in the CMMC Findings Brief template, are then presented to the Organization Seeking Certification (OSC). This presentation ensures that the OSC receives a clear and standardized report of the assessment outcomes.

References:

CMMC Assessment Process documentation emphasizes the requirement for the Lead Assessor to use the CMMC Findings Brief template for presenting Final Recommended Assessment Findings.

Question #:142 - [CMMC Ecosystem] A contractor has implemented IA.L2-3.5.3: Multifactor Authentication practice for their privileged users, however, during the assessment it was discovered that the OSC's standard users do not require MFA to access their endpoints and network resources. What would be the BEST finding?

A. The process is running correctly.

B. It is out of scope as this is a new acquisition.

C. The new acquisition is considered Specialized Assets.

D. Practice is NOT MET since the objective was not implemented. Answer: D

Explanation

Understanding IA.L2-3.5.3: Multifactor Authentication (MFA) RequirementTheIA.L2-3.5.3practice, derived fromNIST SP 800-171 (Requirement 3.5.3), requires thatmultifactor authentication (MFA) be implemented for both privileged and standard userswhen accessing:

#Organizational endpoints(e.g., laptops, desktops, mobile devices).

#Network resources(e.g., VPNs, internal systems).

#Cloud services containing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

Key Requirement for a "MET" RatingFor IA.L2-3.5.3 to beMet, the organization must:

Require MFA for all privileged users(e.g., system administrators).

Require MFA for standard users accessing endpoints and network resources.

Implement MFA across all relevant systems.

Sincestandard users do not require MFA in the OSC’s current implementation, the practiceis not fully implementedand must be ratedNOT MET.

A. The process is running correctly # Incorrect

MFA isonly applied to privileged users, but it isalso required for standard users. The process isnot fully implemented.

B. It is out of scope as this is a new acquisition # Incorrect

New acquisitionsmust still meet MFA requirementsif they handle CUI or network access.

C. The new acquisition is considered Specialized Assets # Incorrect

Specialized assets (e.g., IoT, legacy systems) may have alternative security controls, but standard users and endpointsmust still comply with MFA.

D. Practice is NOT MET since the objective was not implemented # Correct

MFA must be enabled for both privileged and standard usersaccessing endpoints and network resources. Since standard users are excluded, the practice isNOT MET.

Why is the Correct Answer "D" (Practice is NOT MET since the objective was not implemented)? CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (Advanced) Requirements Specifies thatMFA must be applied to all users accessing CUI and network resources.

NIST SP 800-171 (Requirement 3.5.3 – MFA Implementation) Requires MFA forall user types, including privileged and standard users.

Security Protection Assets (SPA)– Assets that providesecurity functions(e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, identity management systems).

Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMA)– Assets thatdo not directly store/process CUIbut interact with CUI environments (e.g., BYOD devices, personal computers used for remote access).

Specialized Assets– Unique systems such asOperational Technology (OT), IoT, and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), which may requirelimitedCMMC assessment.

Which Asset Categories Are Always Assessed?#1. CUI Assets(ALWAYS ASSESSED) These are theprimary focusof CMMC Level 2 since they handleCUI.

#2. Security Protection Assets (SPA)(ALWAYS ASSESSED) Security tools that protectCUI Assetsarealways includedin the assessment.

Examples includefirewalls, antivirus, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and identity management systems.

(A) CUI Assets and Specialized Assets#

CUI Assets are assessed, butSpecialized Assets are only assessed in a limited manner, depending on their role inCUI security.

(C) Specialized Assets and Contractor Risk Managed Assets#

Specialized Assets and CRMAsare typicallynot fully assessedagainst CMMC controls unless they directly impactCUI security.

(D) Security Protection Assets and Contractor Risk Managed Assets#

SPAs are always assessed, butCRMAs are not necessarily assessedunless they directly impact CUI. TheCMMC Scoping Guide (Level 2)clearly states thatCUI Assets and Security Protection Assetsarealways assessedagainst CMMC practices.

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Answer: D

Explanation

Interview Selection in CMMC AssessmentsDuring aCMMC assessment, theLead Assessormust work with theOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC)to select personnel for interviews. The goal is to:

#Verify that personnel understand andperform security-related practices.

#Ensure that individuals canexplain how they implement CMMC requirements.

#Gain insight intoactual cybersecurity operationsrather than just documented policies.

The best interviewees are those whodirectly engage with security practicesand canclearly explain how they perform their duties.

CMMC assessmentsrely on interviewsto validate that security practices areimplemented effectively. Themost valuable intervieweesare those who canexplainhow security measures are appliedin day-to-day operations.

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)emphasizes that assessors should speak tothose actively involved in security practicesrather than just senior management or policy owners.

Why "Providing Clarity and Understanding" Is KeyThus,option D is the correct choicebecause the Lead Assessor should prioritizeinterviewing personnel who can clearly explain how CMMC practices are implemented.

A. Have a security clearance.#Incorrect.Security clearance is not a requirementfor CMMC assessments. The focus is onpractical implementation of security controls, not classified work.

B. Be a senior person in the company.#Incorrect. Senior executives may not be involved in theactual

implementation of security controls. The best interviewees are those whoperform the work, not just oversee it.

C. Demonstrate expertise on the CMMC requirements.#Incorrect. Whileunderstanding CMMC is important, expertise alonedoes not guarantee practical knowledgeof security controls. The key is thatinterviewees must provide clarity on how they perform security tasks.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Document– Guides interview selection based on personnel who perform security functions.

NIST SP 800-171 & CMMC 2.0– Emphasize that cybersecurity controls must beactively implemented, not just documented.

TheWi-Fi-enabled thermostat is connected to the FCI network, meaning it haspotential accessto sensitive contract-related data.

PerCMMC Scoping Guidance, this type of device is classified as aRestricted Information System (Restricted IS)—devices that do not store, process, or transmit FCI but areconnected to networks that do.

Restricted IS must be accounted for in the self-assessment scope to ensure they do not compromise security controls.

Reference:

CMMC Level 1 Scoping Guidance CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Guide Step 3: Why Other Answer Choices Are IncorrectA. No, because it is OT (Incorrect):

Operational Technology (OT)includesindustrial control systemsbut does not exempt a device from assessmentif it connects to an FCI network.

B. No, because it is an IoT device (Incorrect):

IoT (Internet of Things) devicesthat areconnected to an FCI network must be assessedto ensure they do not create security vulnerabilities.

D. Yes, because it is government property (Incorrect):

Theownershipof the device (government or company) doesnotdetermine its inclusion in the CMMC assessment scope—its network connectivity does.

Final Confirmation of Correct Answer:The thermostat is part of the CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment Scope as a Restricted IS.

Thus, the correct answer is:C. Yes, because it is a restricted IS

Explanation

CMMC Level 2 requires full implementation of the 110 security requirements specified in NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. These practices form the foundation for safeguarding CUI across defense contractor systems.

NIST SP 800-53 is a broader catalog of security controls for federal systems, not specific to CUI in the defense contractor environment.

48 CFR 52.204-21 establishes basic safeguarding requirements for Federal Contract Information (FCI) and corresponds to CMMC Level 1.

DFARS 252.204-7012 defines safeguarding and incident reporting obligations but does not enumerate the specific security practices required.

Thus, Level 2 practices are aligned to NIST SP 800-171.

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Ensures Data Protection:The client laptop is likely configured to meet security controls required for handling assessment-related materials.

Prevents Data Spillage:Keeping all assessment-related activities within the client’s secured environment reduces the risk ofdata leakage or unauthorized storage.

Maintains Compliance with CMMC/NIST Guidelines:Using aproperly configured client laptop and secured connectionensures compliance withNIST SP 800-171 controls on secure remote access(Requirement3.13.12).

A. "Log into the secure cloud storage service to save copies of the documents on both the work and client laptops."

Incorrect#Sensitive data should not be duplicated across multiple systems, especially a non-client-approved laptop. Storing it on an unauthorized systemviolates data handling best practices.

C. "Log into the client VPN from the assessor's laptop and retrieve the documents from the secure cloud storage service."

Incorrect# Theassessor’s laptop may not be authorizedorsecuredto handle client data. CMMC guidelines emphasizeusing approved, secured systemsfor assessment-related information.

D. "Use their home office workstation to retrieve the documents from the secure cloud storage service and save them to a USB stick."

Incorrect# Transferring sensitive documents via USBintroduces security risks, including unauthorized data storage and potential malware contamination.

Question #:163 - [CMMC Ecosystem]

An employee is the primary system administrator for an OSC. The employee will be a core part of the assessment, as they perform most of the duties in managing and maintaining the systems. What would the employee be BEST categorized as?

A. Analyzer

B. Inspector

C. Applicable staff

D. Demonstration staff

Answer: C

Explanation

In the context of a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) assessment, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved are clearly delineated to ensure a structured and effective evaluation process. The term "applicable staff" refers to personnel within the Organization Seeking Certification (OSC) who possess specific knowledge or expertise pertinent to the assessment. These individuals are integral to the assessment process as they provide essential information, demonstrate the implementation of security practices, and facilitate the assessment team's understanding of the organization's cybersecurity posture.

In this scenario, the employee serving as the primary system administrator is responsible for managing and maintaining the organization's systems. Given their comprehensive understanding of the system configurations, security controls, and operational procedures, this individual is best categorized as "applicable staff." Their involvement is crucial during the assessment, as they can provide detailed insights, demonstrate compliance measures, and address technical inquiries from the assessment team.

The other options can be delineated as follows:

Analyzer:Typically refers to individuals who analyze data or security incidents, often as part of a security operations center. This role is not specifically defined within the CMMC assessment context.

Inspector:Generally denotes a person who examines or inspects systems and processes, possibly as part of an internal audit or compliance check. This term is not a standard designation within the CMMC assessment framework.

Demonstration staff:While this could imply personnel responsible for demonstrating systems or processes, it is not a recognized role within the CMMC assessment process.

Therefore, the primary system administrator, by virtue of their role and responsibilities, aligns with the "applicable staff" category, playing a pivotal role in facilitating a successful CMMC assessment.

B. DFARS, FIPS 100, and NIST SP 800-171

C. DFARS, NIST, and Carnegie Mellon University

D. DFARS, FIPS 100, NIST SP 800-171, and Carnegie Mellon University Answer: A

Explanation

TheCybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0is primarily based on two key National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications:

NIST SP 800-171– "Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations" NIST SP 800-172– "Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to NIST Special Publication 800-171" NIST SP 800-171 This document is thecore foundationof CMMC 2.0 and establishes the security requirements for protectingControlled Unclassified Information (CUI)in non-federal systems.

The 110 security controls fromNIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2are mapped directly toCMMC Level 2.

NIST SP 800-172 This supplement includesenhanced security requirementsfor organizations handlinghigh-value CUIthat faces advanced persistent threats (APTs).

These enhanced requirements apply toCMMC Level 3under the 2.0 model.

C. All entities, regardless of the line of business, associated with the organization

D. All assets processing, storing, or transmitting FCI/CUI and security protection assets Answer: D

Explanation

Scoping Requirements in CMMC AssessmentsTheCMMC 2.0 Scoping GuideandCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Documentclearly define what should be included in the scope of an assessment.

The assessment scope must cover:

All assets that process, store, or transmit FCI/CUI Security Protection Assets (ESP)– these assets help protect FCI/CUI, such as firewalls, endpoint detection systems, and encryption mechanisms.

Thus, thecorrect scope includes both:

#FCI/CUI Assets(Data storage, processing, or transmission assets) #Security Protection Assets (ESP)(Firewalls, security tools, etc.)

A. All assets documented in the business plan#Incorrect.Business plans may include assets unrelated to FCI /CUI, making this scopetoo broad. Only assets relevant to FCI/CUI should be assessed.

B. All assets regardless if they do or do not process, store, or transmit FCI/CUI#Incorrect. CMMC doesnotrequire organizations to include assets thathave no connection to FCI/CUI.

C. All entities, regardless of the line of business, associated with the organization#Incorrect.Only the assets relevant to FCI/CUI or security protection should be assessed. Unrelated business divisions (like a non-federal commercial division) areout-of-scope.

Question #:167 - [CMMC Model Overview] Which term describes "the protective measures that are commensurate with the consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to. or modification of information"?

A. Adopted security

B. Adaptive security

C. Adequate security

D. Advanced security Answer: C

Explanation

Understanding the Concept of Security in CMMC 2.0CMMC 2.0 aligns with federal cybersecurity standards, particularlyFISMA (Federal Information Security Modernization Act), NIST SP 800-171, and FAR 52.204-

21. One key principle in these frameworks is the implementation of security measures that are appropriate for the risk level associated with the data being protected.

The question describes security measures that are proportionate to therisk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or modificationof information. This matches the definition of"Adequate Security."

A. Adopted security# Incorrect

The term"adopted security"is not officially recognized in CMMC, NIST, or FISMA. Organizations adopt security policies, but the concept does not directly align with the question’s definition.

B. Adaptive security# Incorrect

Adaptive securityrefers to adynamic cybersecurity modelwhere security measures continuously evolve based on real-time threats. While important, it does not directly match the definition in the question.

C. Adequate security#Correct

The term"adequate security"is defined inNIST SP 800-171, DFARS 252.204-7012, and FISMAas the level of protection that isproportional to the consequences and likelihood of a security incident.

This aligns perfectly with the definition in the question.

D. Advanced security# Incorrect

Advanced securitytypically refers tohighly sophisticated cybersecurity mechanisms, such as AI-driven threat detection. However, the term does not explicitly relate to the concept of risk-based proportional security.

Leaders in it certification

198 of 246

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

FISMA (44 U.S.C. § 3552(b)(3)) Definesadequate securityas"protective measures commensurate with the risk and potential impact of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information."

This directly matches the question's wording.

DFARS 252.204-7012 (Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting) Mandates that contractors apply"adequate security"to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Requirement 3.1.1 States that organizations must "limit system access to authorized users and implement adequate security protections to prevent unauthorized disclosure."

CMMC 2.0 Documentation (Level 1 and Level 2 Requirements) Requires that organizationsapply adequate security measures in accordance with NIST SP 800-171to meet compliance standards.

Analyzing the Given OptionsOfficial References Supporting the Correct AnswerConclusionThe term" adequate security"is the correct answer because it is explicitly defined in federal cybersecurity frameworks asprotection proportional to risk and potential consequences. Thus, the verified answer is:

Question #:168 - [CMMC Model Overview] A company is about to conduct a press release. According to AC.L1-3.1.22: Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible systems, what is the MOST important factor to consider when addressing CMMC requirements?

A. That the information is correct

B. That the CEO approved the message

C. That the company has to safeguard the release of FCI

D. That so long as the information is only FCI, it can be released Answer: C

Explanation

AC.L1-3.1.22states:"Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible systems."

This control requires organizations toensure that FCI (Federal Contract Information) is not publicly postedor made accessible in an uncontrolled manner.

FCI must beprotected from unauthorized disclosure, even if it is not classified or CUI.

FCI includesinformation provided by or generated for theDoD under a contractthat isnot intended for public release.

Organizations mustimplement controlsto prevent unintentional exposure.

Step 3: Why Other Answer Choices Are IncorrectA. That the information is correct (Incorrect):

While accuracy is important,CMMC requirements focus on protecting sensitive information, not just ensuring correctness.

B. That the CEO approved the message (Incorrect):

CEO approval does not satisfy CMMC compliance, as it does not address safeguarding FCI.

D. That so long as the information is only FCI, it can be released (Incorrect):

FCI must be protected and cannot be publicly disclosed unless specifically authorizedby the DoD.

Final Confirmation of Correct Answer:The company must safeguard FCI and ensure that no unauthorized disclosures occur in a public press release.

C. Scanned for malicious code

D. Limited to mission-essential use only Answer: A

Explanation

Understanding Configuration Management (CM) in CMMC Level 2InCMMC Level 2, theConfiguration Management (CM) domainis critical for ensuring that systems aresecurely configured, maintained, and monitoredto prevent unauthorized changes. One key aspect of CM is managinguser-installed software, which can introducesecurity risksif not properly controlled.

The correct approach to managinguser-installed softwarealigns withCM.3.068fromNIST SP 800-171, which requires organizations to:

#Establish and enforce configuration settingsto ensure security.

#Monitor and control user-installed softwareto prevent unauthorized or insecure applications from running on organizational systems.

Why "Controlled and Monitored" is Correct?The CCP (Certified CMMC Professional) conducting theinterviewshould focus on whether theuser-installed softwareiscontrolled and monitoredto align withCMMC Level 2 requirements. This means verifying:

Approval processesfor user-installed software.

Monitoring mechanisms(e.g., system logs, audits) to track software changes.

Policies that restrict unauthorized installationsto prevent security risks.

Breakdown of Answer ChoicesOption Description Correct?

A. Controlled and monitored

#Ensures compliance with CM.3.068, verifying that user-installed software ismanaged securely. #Correct

B. Removed from the system

Software isnot always removed—only unauthorized or risky software should be. #Incorrect

Question #:172 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] A Lead Assessor has been assigned to a CMMC Assessment During the assessment, one of the assessors approaches with a signed policy. There is one signatory, and that person has since left the company. Subsequently, another person was hired into that position but has not signed the document. Is this document valid?

A. The signatory is the authority to implement and enforce the policy, and since that person is no longer with the company, the policy is not valid.

B. More research on the company policy of creating, implementing, and enforcing policies is needed. If the company has a policy identifying the authority as with the position or person, then the policy is valid.

C. The signatory does not validate or invalidate the policy. For the purpose of this assessment, ensuring that the policy is current and is being implemented by the individuals who are performing the work is sufficient.

D. The authority to implement and enforce lies with the position, not the person. As long as that position's authority and responsibilities have not been removed from implementing that domain, it is still a valid policy.

Answer: C

Explanation

Understanding Policy Validation in CMMC AssessmentsDuring a CMMC assessment, policies must be evaluated based on:

Who has the authority to approve and enforce them Whether they are current and implemented effectively

Leaders in it certification

204 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

The validity of a policydoes not solely depend on the signatorybut rather onhow the organization assigns authority for policy creation, approval, and enforcement.

Some organizations assignauthority to a specific person, meaning anew signatory may be requiredwhen leadership changes.

Others assign authority to aposition/title(e.g., CISO, IT Director), in which casea new signature may not be requiredas long as the role remains responsible for policy enforcement.

The assessment teammust review the organization's policy management processto determine if the policy remains valid despite leadership turnover.

Key Considerations in Policy Validation:Thus,the correct answer is B, as additional research is needed to confirm whether the organization's policy is tied to the individual or the position.

A. The signatory is the authority to implement and enforce the policy, and since that person is no longer with the company, the policy is not valid.#Incorrect. This assumes thatauthority is always tied to a person, which is not always the case. Some organizations delegate authorityto a position, not an individual.

C. The signatory does not validate or invalidate the policy. For the purpose of this assessment, ensuring that the policy is current and is being implemented by the individuals who are performing the work is sufficient. #Incorrect. While implementation is crucial,the authority behind the policy must also be validatedper CMMC documentation requirements.

D. The authority to implement and enforce lies with the position, not the person. As long as that position's authority and responsibilities have not been removed from implementing that domain, it is still a valid policy. #Incorrect. This assumes thatauthority is always assigned to a position, which is not universally true. More research is required to confirm this.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Document– Outlines the importance of verifying the authority and enforcement of policies.

NIST SP 800-171 (3.12.1 - Security Policies and Procedures)– Requires that policies be maintained and enforced by appropriate personnel.

CMMC Official ReferencesThus,option B (More research on the company policy is needed) is the correct answer, as per official CMMC policy validation guidance.

Question #:173 - [CMMC Ecosystem] A test or demonstration is being performed for the Assessment Team during an assessment. Which environment MUST the OSC perform this test or demonstration?

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

D. Demonstration Answer: B

Explanation

During aCMMC Level 2 assessment, assessors requireobjective evidencethat security controls are implementedin the actual operating environmentwhereControlled Unclassified Information (CUI)is handled. This means thattests or demonstrations must be conducted in the production environment, where the organization’s real systems and security controls are in use.

Assessment teams need to validate security controls in the actual environment where they are applied, ensuring that security measures are in effect in thereal-world operating conditions.

Option A (Client)is incorrect because "Client" is not a defined assessment environment.

Option C (Development)is incorrect because testing in a development environmentdoes not accurately represent the production security posture.

Option D (Demonstration)is incorrect becausedemonstrations in a separate test environment do not provide valid evidence for CMMC assessments—actual security implementations must be verified in production.

Understanding the "Examine" Assessment Method in CMMC 2.0CMMC 2.0 usesthree assessment methodsto evaluate security compliance:

Examine– Reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing assessment objects (e.g., policies, system documentation).

Interview– Speaking with personnel to verify knowledge and responsibilities.

Test– Performing technical validation to check system configurations.

TheCMMC Assessment Process (CAP)definesExamineas the method used toreview or analyze assessment objects, such as policies, procedures, configurations, and logs.

Relevant CMMC 2.0 Reference:

A. Test # Incorrect

"Test" involvesexecutinga function to validate its security (e.g., verifying access controls through a live system test).

B. Assess # Incorrect

"Assess" is a broad term; CMMC explicitly defines "Examine" as the method for reviewing documentation.

C. Examine # Correct

"Examine" is the official term forreviewing policies, procedures, configurations, or logs.

D. Interview # Incorrect

"Interview" involvesverbal discussions with personnel, not document analysis.

Why is the Correct Answer "Examine" (C)?

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) Document Defines "Examine" asanalyzing assessment objects (e.g., policies, procedures, logs, documentation). NIST SP 800-171A Specifies "Examine" as a method toreview security controls and configurations.

Question #:176 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)] An assessor is in Phase 3 of the CMMC Assessment Process. The assessor has delivered the final findings, submitted the assessment results package, and provided feedback to the C3PAO and CMMC-AB. What must the assessor still do?

A. Determine level recommendation

B. Archive all assessment artifacts

C. Determine final practice pass/fail results

D. Archive or dispose of any assessment artifacts Answer: D

Explanation

In Phase 3 (Post-Assessment), the assessor’s responsibility is to archive or dispose of assessment artifacts according to the C3PAO’s policies and retention requirements. By this point, final findings and results have already been delivered, so the only remaining step is ensuring proper handling of assessment materials. Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CAP v2.0, Post-Assessment Activities (§3.17): “The assessor must archive or dispose of any

assessment artifacts in accordance with the C3PAO’s retention and destruction policy.” Why Option D is Correct:

A. Cybersecurity

B. Data security

C. Network security

D. Information security Answer: A

Explanation

The term that describes"the prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers and electronic communication systems/services, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation"isCybersecurity.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:#1. Cybersecurity Defined Cybersecurityfocuses onprotecting networks, systems, and datafrom cyber threats.

It includes measures to ensure:

Availability(data is accessible when needed).

Integrity(data is accurate and unaltered).

Authentication(verifying users' identities).

Confidentiality(ensuring only authorized access).

Non-repudiation(preventing denial of actions).

The definition in the questionaligns directly with cybersecurity principles, making it the best answer.

#2. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(B) Data Security#

Data securityfocusesspecificallyon protectingstored information(e.g., encryption, access controls), but cybersecurity is broader—it includesnetworks, systems, and communication services.

(C) Network Security#

Network securityis asubset of cybersecuritythat focuses on protectingnetwork infrastructure(e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems).

The definition in the question includesmore than just networks, so cybersecurity is the better choice.

(D) Information Security#

Information security (InfoSec)is related but broader than cybersecurity.

InfoSeccoversphysical and organizational security(e.g., policies, procedures) in addition todigital protections. CMMC and NIST SP 800-171 define cybersecurityas the protection ofsystems, networks, and data from cyber threats.

DoD Cybersecurity Definitions(aligned with NIST) confirm that cybersecurity is the term thatbest fits the definition in the question.

TheAccess Control (AC) domain in CMMCis based onNIST SP 800-171 (3.1 Access Control family)and includes requirements to:

#Implement policies for granting and revoking access.

#Restrict access to authorized personnel only.

#Protect physical and digital assets from unauthorized access.

Since the questionbroadly asks about the process of granting or denying access to information, services, and physical locations, the correct answer isA. Access Control.

B. Physical access control#Incorrect.Physical access controlis asubsetof access control that only applies tophysical locations(e.g., keycards, security guards, biometrics). The question includesinformation and services, makinggeneral access controlthe correct choice.

C. Mandatory access control (MAC)#Incorrect.MAC is a specific type of access controlwhere access is

strictly enforced based onsecurity classifications(e.g., Top Secret, Secret, Confidential). The questiondoes not specify MAC, so this is incorrect.

D. Discretionary access control (DAC)#Incorrect.DAC is another specific type of access control,

whereownersof data decide who can access it. The question asksgenerallyabout granting/denying access, makingaccess control (A)the best answer.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect CMMC 2.0 Model - AC.L2-3.1.1 to AC.L2-3.1.22– Covers access control requirements, includingcontrolling access to information, services, and physical spaces.

NIST SP 800-171 (3.1 - Access Control Family)– Defines the general principles of access control.

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Explanation

For a practice to beadequately implementedin aCMMC Level 2 assessment, theresponsible personnel must demonstrate knowledge of deployment, maintenance, and operationof security tools such asantivirus programs. Simply having the tool in place isnot sufficient—there must be evidence that it isproperly configured, updated, and monitoredto protect against threats.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:#1. Relevant CMMC and NIST SP 800-171 Requirements CMMC Level 2 aligns with NIST SP 800-171, which includes:

Requirement 3.14.5 (System and Information Integrity - SI-3):

"Employautomatedmechanisms toidentify, report, and correctsystem flaws in a timely manner." Requirement 3.14.6 (SI-3(2)):

"Employautomated toolsto detect and prevent malware execution."

These requirements imply that theperson responsible for antivirus must understand how it is deployed and maintainedto ensure compliance.

#2. Why the Team Member’s Knowledge is Insufficient Antivirus tools requireregular updates,configuration adjustments, andmonitoringto function properly.

The responsible team member must:

Knowhow the antivirus was deployedacross systems.

Be able toconfirm updates, logs, and alerts are monitored.

Understand how torespond to malware detectionsand failures.

If the team member lacks this knowledge, assessors maydetermine the practice is not fully implemented. #3. Why the Other Answer Choices Are Incorrect:

(A) Yes, the antivirus program is available, so it is sufficient.#

Incorrect:Just having antivirus softwareinstalleddoes not prove compliance. It must bemanaged and maintained.

(B) Yes, antivirus programs are automated to run independently.#

Incorrect:While automation helps, security toolsrequire oversight, updates, and configuration.

(D) No, the team member's interview answers about deployment and maintenance are insufficient.#

Partially correct but incomplete:Themain issueis that the team membermust have sufficient knowledge, not just that their answers are weak.

Question #:194 - [CMMC Model Overview] An organization that manufactures night vision cameras is looking for help to address the gaps identified in physical access control systems. Which certified individual should they approach for implementation support?

A. CCA of the C3PAO performing the assessment

B. RP of an organization not part of the assessment

C. Practitioner of the organization performing the assessment LTP

D. DoD Contract Official of the organization performing the assessment Answer: B

Explanation

Anorganization seeking helpto address security gaps—such asphysical access control deficiencies—needs acertified professional who can provide implementation supportwithoutbeing involved in the actual CMMC assessment.

A Registered Practitioner (RP)is a CMMC-certified individualwho provides consulting and implementation supportto organizations butdoes not perform assessments.

RPs work independently from C3PAOsand canassist in fixing gapsin security controlsbeforeorafteran assessment.

Since RPs are not assessors, they can provide direct remediation supportwithout any conflict of interest. The OSC needs assistance in implementing security controls(not assessment).

An RP is trained and authorized to provide remediation and advisory services.

Conflict of interest rules prevent the assessing C3PAO from providing implementation support.

A. CCA of the C3PAO performing the assessment (Incorrect)

Question #:197 - [CMMC Assessment Process (CAP)]

The Assessment Team has completed the assessment and determined the preliminary practice ratings. The preliminary practice ratings must be shared with the OSC prior to being finalized for submission. Based on this information, the assessor should present the preliminary practice ratings:

A. During the final Daily Checkpoint

B. After discussing with the CMMC-AB

C. Via email after the final Daily Checkpoint

D. Over the phone after the final Daily Checkpoint

Answer: A

Explanation

According to the CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) v2.0, assessors are required to conduct Daily Checkpoint Meetings at the end of each day to summarize progress with the OSC (Organization Seeking Certification). The final Daily Checkpoint is where preliminary practice ratings are shared, before the quality assurance review and Out-Brief. The Out-Brief is reserved for the presentation of final results. Additionally, Department of Defense regulations (32 CFR §170.17(c)(2)) provide a 10-business-day re-evaluation window for requirements marked NOT MET before the final report is delivered, which necessitates that the OSC see preliminary ratings during the assessment process itself.

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CAP v2.0, §2.23: “The assessment team shall host a Daily Checkpoint Meeting with the OSC at the end of each assessment day to summarize progress.”

CAP v2.0, §3.7: “The C3PAO shall conduct the quality assurance review… prior to the conduct of the Out-Brief Meeting.”

CAP v2.0, §3.10: “The purpose of the Out-Brief Meeting is to convey the results of the assessment to the OSC.”

32 CFR §170.17(c)(2): “A security requirement assessed as NOT MET may be re-evaluated… for 10 business days… if the CMMC Assessment Findings Report has not been delivered.”

Leaders in it certification

234 of 246

Practice Exam

Cyber AB - CMMC-CCP

Why Option A is Correct:

The CAP specifies that Daily Checkpoint Meetings are the formal, structured mechanism for assessors to communicate progress and preliminary findings to the OSC.

The final Daily Checkpoint provides the OSC with visibility into the preliminary practice ratings before they are finalized, ensuring transparency and alignment.

The Out-Brief is explicitly for conveying the final assessment results after the C3PAO has completed QA.

Federal regulation (32 CFR §170.17(c)(2)) requires the OSC to have access to preliminary results so they can provide additional evidence for re-evaluation before the report is locked, further confirming that this exchange must occur at the final Daily Checkpoint.

Explanation

During aCMMC readiness review, anOrganization Seeking Certification (OSC)may argue that a specificenclave (network segment or system) is out of scopefor assessment. TheLead Assessor is responsible for verifying and approving this request.

Certified CMMC Professional (CCP) A CCP supports OSCs inpreparing for assessmentsbutdoes not make final scope determinations.

Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO) The C3PAOoversees the assessmentbut doesnot personally verify scope exclusions—that falls under theLead Assessor’s role.

Lead Assessor (Correct Answer) TheLead Assessor has the authorityto determine if anenclave is out of scopebased on OSC-provided evidence. The Lead Assessor followsCMMC Assessment Process (CAP) guidelinesto ensure proper scoping.

Advisory Board TheCMMC-AB (Advisory Board) does not make scope determinations. It focuses onprogram oversightandcertification processes.

CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) v1.0 TheLead Assessor is responsible for confirming the assessment scopeand determining enclave applicability. CMMC Scoping Guidance for Level 2 Assessments Requires theLead Assessor to review and approve any enclave exclusionsbefore finalizing the assessment scope.

Roles and Responsibilities in CMMC Assessments:Official References Supporting the Correct Answer: Conclusion:TheLead Assessoris the correct answer because they have the authority to verify scope determinations during the assessment.

C. False Claims Act

D. Code of Professional Conduct Answer: C

Explanation

Understanding the False Claims Act (FCA) and Whistleblower ProtectionsTheFalse Claims Act (FCA)(31 U. S.C. §§ 3729–3733) is aU.S. federal lawthat allowswhistleblowers (also known as "relators")to sue on behalf of the federal government if they believe a company issubmitting fraudulent claimsfor government funds. The FCA includes a"qui tam" provision, which:

#Allows private individuals to file lawsuits on behalf of the U.S. government.

#Provides financial rewards to whistleblowersif the lawsuit results in recovered funds.

#Protects whistleblowers from employer retaliation.

In the context ofCMMC and cybersecurity compliance, theFCA has been used to hold companies accountableformisrepresenting their cybersecurity compliancewhen working with federal contracts.

For example:

If a companyfalsely claimscompliance withCMMC, NIST SP 800-171, or DFARS 252.204-7012butfails to meet security requirements, it could beliable under the FCA.

TheDepartment of Justice (DOJ)has pursued cases under theCyber-Fraud Initiative, using theFCA against defense contractorsfor cybersecurity noncompliance.

Thus, the correct answer isC. False Claims Actbecause it specifically allows whistleblowers tosue on behalf of the federal government.

A. NIST SP 800-53#Incorrect.NIST SP 800-53provides security controls for federal agencies butdoes notcontain whistleblower provisions.

B. NIST SP 800-171#Incorrect.NIST SP 800-171outlines security requirements for protectingCUI, but itdoes not have legal mechanismsfor whistleblower lawsuits.

D. Code of Professional Conduct#Incorrect. TheCMMC Code of Professional Conductapplies toC3PAOs and assessorsbut doesnot provide a legal basis for whistleblower lawsuits.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733)– Establishes whistleblower protections and qui tam lawsuits. DOJ Cyber-Fraud Initiative– Uses the FCA to enforce cybersecurity compliance in government contracts. DFARS 252.204-7012 & CMMC– Require accurate reporting of cybersecurity compliance, which can lead to FCA violations if misrepresented.

Question #:204 - [CMMC Model Overview] Which CMMC Levels focus on protecting CUI from exfiltration?

A. Levels 1 and 2

B. Levels 1 and 3

C. Levels 2 and 3

D. Levels 1, 2, and 3 Answer: C

Explanation

Level 1 only addresses the protection of Federal Contract Information (FCI) and does not include requirements for safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

Level 2 is explicitly designed to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). It requires implementation of all 110 security requirements from NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, which directly support the safeguarding of CUI and help prevent its unauthorized disclosure or exfiltration.

Level 3 builds on Level 2 by including a subset of requirements from NIST SP 800-172. These additional practices are designed to enhance the protection of CUI against advanced persistent threats (APTs), further strengthening defenses against exfiltration.

Therefore, the levels that focus on protecting CUI from exfiltration are Levels 2 and 3.

configuration of their FedRAMP-approved applications. The OSC has not won any DoD government contracts yet but is working on two proposals Based on this information, which statement BEST describes the CMMC Level 2 Assessment requirements?

A. Ready because there is no need to certify this company until after they win a DoD contract.

B. Not ready because the OSC is not on contract because they do not know the scope of FCI protection required by the contract.

C. Not ready because the OSC still lacks artifacts that prove they have implemented all the CMMC Level 2 Assessment requirements.

D. Ready because all DoD contractors are required to achieve CMMC Level 2; therefore, they are being proactive in seeking certification.

Answer: C

Explanation

CMMC Level 2 Readiness and Certification RequirementsCMMCLevel 2is required forOrganizations Seeking Certification (OSCs) that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)and aligns withNIST SP 800-171's 110 security controls.

Key Readiness Indicators for a Level 2 Assessment:

The OSC must have implemented all 110 security practices from NIST SP 800-171.

Documented and validated cybersecurity policies and procedures must exist.

The OSC must be prepared to provide objective evidence (artifacts) proving compliance.

Why the OSC in the Question is Not Ready:

They have not won a DoD contract yet# This means they do not yet have a contractually definedCUI environment, which is the foundation for defining their security scope.

They have only provided FCI-related artifacts(e.g., visitor logs, workstation policies, FedRAMP configurations).

Lack of full documentation of CMMC Level 2 controls# The assessment requiresevidence for all 110 security practices(e.g., system security plans, incident response records, security awareness training documentation).

A. "Ready because there is no need to certify this company until after they win a DoD contract."

Incorrect# Some organizationsseek certification proactivelybefore winning contracts. However, readiness depends on implementingall 110 required controls, not contract status alone.

B. "Not ready because the OSC is not on contract because they do not know the scope of FCI protection required by the contract."

Incorrect# CMMC Level 2focuses on CUI, not just FCI. While FCI protection is important, the assessment’s focus is onCUI security requirements, which arenot fully addressed by the provided artifacts.

D. "Ready because all DoD contractors are required to achieve CMMC Level 2; therefore, they are being proactive in seeking certification."

Incorrect# While it is commendable that the OSC is being proactive,readiness is based on full compliance with NIST SP 800-171, not just intent.

Question #:206 - [CMMC Model Overview] The Advanced Level in CMMC will contain Access Control (AC) practices from:

A. Level 1

B. Level 3

C. Levels 1 and 2

D. Levels 1, 2, and 3 Answer: D

Explanation

The CMMC Model v2.0 is cumulative. The Advanced Level (Level 3) requires full implementation of NIST SP 800-171 (aligned to Level 2) and adds a subset of additional practices from NIST SP 800-172. Because levels build on one another, the Access Control (AC) practices at Level 3 inherently include those from Level 1 (basic FCI protections), Level 2 (CUI protections), and additional Level 3 requirements.

Supporting Extracts from Official Content:

CMMC Model v2.0 Overview: “The model is cumulative; practices at a higher level include the

practices of all lower levels.”

Level 3 description: “Advanced… Expert Level requires implementation of NIST SP 800-171 plus a

subset of NIST SP 800-172.” Why Option D is Correct:
